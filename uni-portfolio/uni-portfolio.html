            <p>
                Detailing of the coursework completed while studying for BSc 
                (HONS) Computer Science qualification at the University of 
                Portsmouth. The work completed in the second and third years (along
                with undertaken exams) contributed to attaining a 'First Class' 
                qualification.

                This page is structured such that each section looks at each year
                at university, and each subheading of each year describes the work undertaken
                for a particular unit.

                    <h2>Year 3</h2>
                    <h3>Indiviual Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        In my final year I chose to complete an individual 
                        project based around developing an Android app for 
                        novice programmers that delivered Parson's problems,
                        used to test the users skills in Java. This topic was 
                        driven by the academic impetus that many studies have
                        been undertaken which suggest that Parson's problems
                        may be more beneficial to a beginner programmer's 
                        learning than traditional code writing and code reading
                        exercises. The report for the project details the 
                        development process including a literature review and
                        sections on requirements, design, implementation, and
                        evaluation, and can be read
                        <a href="docs/fyp.pdf" >here</a>. 
                        The repo for the app is over
                        <a href="https://github.com/dym4xion/JPPwSM" >here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Security and Cryptography</h3>
                    <p>
                        This unit was conducted in two parts. The first looked 
                        at general security (such as digital certificates, PKIs
                        and security protocols) and the second part looked more
                        explicitly at cryptographic methods (such as ancient and 
                        modern ciphers, key exchange, hashing functions and 
                        secure random number generation). This unit didn't produce anything
                        that interesting to look at as each of the assessments
                        where either exams/tests or coursework that was tasked
                        with answering exam style questions.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-decoration:line-through">
                        In the near future I would like to implement the basic
                        cryptography tools (Frequency Analyser, Index of Coincidence,
                        Caesar en/decipher, Substitution en/decipher, Vigenere 
                        en/decipher), to develop my C++ skills. When that is
                        done I'll link to a repo here.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Distributed Systems and Security</h3>
                    <p>
                        This unit was also divided into two parts. The first
                        looked at principles on distributed systems and in doing
                        so I produced a research poster on comparing routing 
                        algorithms in wireless mobile ad hoc networks. This can
                        be read 
                        <a href="docs/manet-routing-poster.pdf" >here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second part of this unit overlapped somewhat with
                        the first part of the previous unit, however it looked more
                        explicitly at the security concerns of distributed systems
                        by considering security at the application, transport, and
                        network layers of the OSI model.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Theoretical Computer Science</h3>
                    <p>
                        As this unit was was wholly assessed with exams, again,
                        there is not much interesting to show. Throughout this
                        unit a greater understanding of computational theory was
                        established by studying topics on formal languages and 
                        models of computing
                        such as: languages and grammars, regular languages and
                        regular expressions, the Chomsky hierarchy of languages,
                        finite automata, pushdown automata, turing machines, and 
                        determinism. This area of study also looked at the problem and
                        computability theory surrounding P/NP/NP-complete/NP-hard 
                        problems.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Fuzzy Systems and Networks</h3>
                    <p>
                        This unit introduced to me concepts around fuzzy 
                        logic, and the theoretical systems that expand on fuzzy logic
                        to create fuzzy systems and networks that can be used in
                        different applications such as system control, recognition, 
                        prediction and diagnosis. As part of the assessment for
                        this unit I wrote a research paper on the application of 
                        a Simple Fuzzy System for PWR control which can be read
                        <a href="docs/sfs-pwr-controller.pdf" >here</a>.
                    </p>
               </section>        
               
               <section>
                    <h2>Year 2</h2>
                    <h3>3D Computer Graphics and Animation</h3>
                    <p>
                       In this I unit studied theoretical concepts of 3D graphics
                       such as modelling methods, lighting models and the graphics 
                       pipeline. As well as this, animation principles such as key
                       framing. This theory was put into practice in the coursework
                       where I had to produce a render of a human body in a setting
                       as well as render a video animation of some non-trivial human
                       activity. While I was not fully satisfied with my render of 
                       a person or the animation, the clarity of the report 
                       demonstrating the techniques used in 3ds Max helped
                       to maintain a decent mark.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The report for this coursework can be seen

                    <h3>Advanced Programming Concepts</h3>
                    <p>
                        This unit furthered programming skills acquired in the
                        first year, focusing more on using Java. As such, a box ordering system 
                        using Swing/AWT with 
                        Java was developed with three other students.
                        The repository for my fork of that program can be seen
                        <a href="https://github.com/dym4xion/APROC">here</a>.
                        and the development report for the coursework can be seen
                        <a href="docs/adproc-report.pdf" >here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the second half of the unit we studied more theoretical
                        concepts around programming languages such as context free
                        gammars and compilers.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Computer Operating Systems and Intermediate Networking</h3>
                    <p>
                        This unit looked furthered our knowledge in the role of the
                        operating system and the concerns surrounding them. To
                        investigate this we needed to have a decent undertanding 
                        of Java to run experiments that thinking about threads and
                        race conditions, mutual exclusion, synchronisation, remote
                        method invocation, file primitives and parallel programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second part of the unit furthered networking knowledge
                        by investigating static and dynamic routing, addressing, and
                        sub-netting and supernetting. The Riverbed Academic Modeller
                        was used to simulate networks using the RIP and OSPF routing
                        protocols.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The work for this unit is catalogued in a 'lab book' maintained
                        throughout the completion of the unit that can be seen
                        <a href="docs/cosine-lab-book.pdf" >here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
                    <p>
                        As this unit was exam assessed, there is little to show off,
                        however, in studying this unit, a far greater understanding
                        of algorithms from a theoretical perspective was achieved.
                        As such I gained knowledge on how to consider the order of
                        complexity of certain algorithms, as well as an understanding
                        of data structures I had not previously met such as Binary
                        Search Trees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In preparation for the unit I attempted to implement some
                        of the algorithms that would be discussed in Python and
                        Java. This can be seen
                        <a href="https://github.com/dym4xion/DSALG-prep-algorithms">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Discrete Mathematics and Functional Programming</h3>
                    <p>
                       This unit introduced several mathematical concepts core to
                       the study of Computer Science, such as: logic, set theory,
                       functions, relations, and graph theory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second part of this unit used Haskell to teach functional
                        programming concepts. I particularly enjoyed this as I was
                        impressed at how the expressiveness of functional programming 
                        meant that quite complex routines could be written in a brief
                        way. See the program I wrote for this unit
                        <a href="https://github.com/dym4xion/MATHFUN-FP-CW">here</a>.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Introduction to Software Engineering</h3>
                    <p>
                        This unit aimed to provide the skills for working in a modern
                        software engineering team working environment. Working with
                        a team of four other students, we produced development documentation
                        such as requirements, designs, and testing schemes. That 
                        documentation can be seen
                        <a href="docs/inse-reports.pdf" >here</a>.
                        Unfortunately I have not been able to retrieve the source 
                        code for this project.

                    <h2>Year 1</h2>
                    <h3>Computer Architecture</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the Computer Architecture unit of my course I exlpored
                        topics such as boolean algebra, logic circuits, CPU 
                        design and the role of operating systems. The four pieces
                        of coursework that follow were produced in collaboration
                        with two other classmates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the first coursework, we were tasked with 
                        designing an intrusion logic circuit that needed to 
                        consider certain switches representing doors and windows 
                        that would output the appropriate alarm for specific 
                        situations. The circuit was designed using
                        <a href="https://logic.ly" >Logicly</a> and a screenshot
                        of the circuit is shown below.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the second coursework for the unit, we aimed to optimise and 
                        prove the optimisation of out Intrusion Circuit developed 
                        during the previous coursework. Through using boolean 
                        algebra and Karnaugh maps, we were able to demonstrate
                        that the circuit we developed in CW1 was optimised. We 
                        were also tasked with simplifiying and converting our 
                        Intrusion Circuit into a circuit entirely comprised of 
                        a universal gate of our choice. We chose to convert our 
                        circuit into a NAND only circuit. Pictured below is that
                        simplified circuit, and the demonstration of the circuit's
                        optimisation can be seen

                    <p>
                        In our third coursework for the unit we were tasked with creating a 
                        poster which discussed the functional elements 
                        surrounding a CPU as well as covering topics such as von
                        Neumann architecture and the fetch-execute cycle.
                        See this poster

                    <p>
                        In our final coursework for the unit we prepared a 
                        presentation to discuss a hypothetical operating system 
                        for a hypothetical Augmented Reality glasses device.

                    <h3>Web Foundations 1</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this unit I developed an understanding of concepts 
                        surrounding the web as well as developing academic 
                        research skills and designing website that consider 
                        accessiblity, usability and semanticism. A literature
                        review for on the topic of mitigating corporate information
                        exposure can be read
                        <a href="docs/mitigating-corporate-info-exposure.pdf" >here</a>.
                        The website developed or this unit is not included in this
                        portfolio as it featured no functions more advanced than
                        what is presented by <em>this</em> website.

                    <h3>Network Fundamentals</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this unit I developed skills involved with the theory 
                        and implementation of networked systems including looking 
                        at the relevant standards utilised in network design.
                        The coursework for the netfun module was completed in a 
                        group with three other students. Part of the assessment 
                        included how we managed and balanced the work as a group, 
                        however, the assessment centered more around the design, 
                        analysis, and simulation of a logical and physical network design 
                        to the specification of a given brief. The written report
                        of the coursework can be accessed
                        <a href="docs/netfun-report.pdf" >here</a>,
                        but below are pictured the logical and and physical design
                        overviews of the network.

                    <h3>Introduction to Database Design and Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this unit I studied the fundamental concepts involved 
                        in the process designing and developing a database and 
                        the business relevancy of databases. For a given case 
                        study, I developed a 
                        <a href="docs/db-dfd.pdf" >level 0 and level 1 data flow diagram</a>
                        to illustrate the relevant data flows
                        between entities within the system. I continued work 
                        based around the case study by developing 
                        <a href="docs/db-erd.pdf" >an entity relationship diagram</a>
                        for the various entities involved.
                        We needed to consider the cardinality of the relationships 
                        as well as ensure the ERD was normalised to the third 
                        normal form. The final coursework for this unit entailed the development
                        of an SQL database from a given ERD and dataset. We then
                        needed to come up with some queries that would provide 
                        useful business information. The report for that coursework
                        can be seen 
                        <a href="docs/db-sql.pdf" >here</a>.

                    <h3>Introduction to Programming</h3>
                    <p>
                       This unit introduced basic programming concepts such as 
                       data types, classes and code quality while utilising the 
                       Python and Java programming languages.

                        The first coursework was conducted in Python and aimed to
                        develop a patchwork sampler program using the
                        <a href="http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py" >John Zelle graphics library</a>.
                        A .zip file containing the Zelle library and my submission
                        can be downloaded
