            <h1>About The 1560 Project</h1>
            <p>
                The 1560 Project aims to celebrate older films. For the next
                ten years I aim to watch three films per week, each of which
                being made before 1981 (a total of 10 * 3 * 52 = 1560 films).
            </p>
            <p>
                1980 being the inclusive cut-off point was chosen somewhat
                arbitrarily. A compromise between the most amount of decades
                of film I was willing to sacrifice while still allowing for
                talking about some of the greatest feature classics that I
                have yet to see. I could have chosen to abstain from the 
                past 50 years of film by making the cut-off 1970 but there 
                is something I find so interesting about films from the '70s
                (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Alien, The Warriors, Network,
                Jaws, The Wicker Man, Westworld) that I enjoy so much that I
                wouldn't want to miss out on film's from that decade that I 
                am still eager to see (Suspiria, The Deer Hunter, Kramer vs.
                Kramer, Stalker). I could have had the project focus on 
                films from the whole of the 20th century, by making the 
                cut-off point 2000, but I felt that this wouldn't have 
                presented much of a challenge at all.

                The project will operate under a set of rules that will
                help to fully realise the aims of the project. These rules 
                are as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>All films must have been released before 1981.</li>
                <li>No film must be watched more than once.</li>
                <li>Films that have been seen before the start of the 
                project cannot be seen again, even if they fit the 
                criteria.</li>
                <li>The three films watched each week must each exist
                within a common (however tenuous) theme.</li>
                <li>Themes may be repeated when appropriate.</li>
                <li>No more than 1000 words may be written each week about
                why the films are good and why/if they work well as a
                thematic trilogy.</li>
                <li>Each film must have a runtime of at least 40 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
