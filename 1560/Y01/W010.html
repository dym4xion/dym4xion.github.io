            <p>Week starting: 2020-11-23</p>


            <h2><em>Heavy Traffic</em> (1973)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W010-traffic.png" >
            <p>
                <em>Heavy Traffic</em> lives upto its Adults Only certification
                and isn't for the faint of heart. Here we get a cartoonishly brutal
                and hyperviolent look at Ralph Bakshi's New York City, blending
                some live action scenery with highly animated characters. At its 
                center is a portrayal of youthful directionlessness and the pains and 
                joys that come with that, as well as exaggerated looks at the interactions
                between NYC's minority communities.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Wizards</em> (1977)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W010-wizards.png" >
            <p>
                Super inventive and visually striking, <em>Wizards</em> considers
                serious topics in a way that is consistently engaging and frequently
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujQ-nMc0WGE">funny</a>.
                Maybe it's in parts unsubtle, but it's a cartoon and can afford 
                to be so without being overbearing. The neo-Nazism its villain invokes
                seems intentionally cartoonish in order to make a bigger point about how 
                visual spectacles can be used to drive hysteria and fear to be wielded to
                cause large-scale death and destruction. Interesting blending of fantasy 
                and modern technology.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>The Lord of the Rings</em> (1978)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W010-rings.png" >
            <p>
                I don't know if it can be said that Bakshi's TLotR is better 
                than Peter Jackson's adaptation, but it's defintely cooler and
                heaps more charming. It's an incopmlete story and finsishes around
                about after the battle at Helm's Deep, but that doesn't mean you
                don't get a high dose of really expressive and human-looking
                rotoscope animation, along with some great voice work and really 
                cool background artwork. The music is well suited, if overly conventional
                (I read on Wikipedia that Bakshi wanted to use some Led Zeppelin
                as part of the soundtrack, which would have been 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM63MqKPw68">fun to see</a>). 
                It would be cool if a second part ever got made.

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2> 
            <p>
                I enjoyed these films a lot and as a trilogy I think they provide
                a decent look at some of the highlights of Bakshi's career.
                In my mind, <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> is the most technically
                refined and functions best as a conventional film (even if the story
                is incomplete) but <em>Wizards</em> and <em>Heavy Traffic</em> are
                conceptually brilliant and shouldn't be missed if given the opportunity
                to see them.
            </p>

                If not restricted by the 1980 inclusive limit then it may have been a
                good idea to do RB's fantasy films one week (<em>Wizards</em>, 
                <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, <em>Fire and Ice</em> (1983)), and
                his films set in NYC another week (<em>Fritz the Cat</em> (1977), 
                <em>Heavy Traffic</em>, <em>Coonskin</em> (1975)). I'd definitely like
                to see some more of his other films if and when I find a thematic triple to 
                put it in them.
