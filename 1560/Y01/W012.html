            <h1>W012: Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau</h1>
            <p>Week starting: 2020-12-07</p>

  
            <h2><em>The Pink Panther</em> (1963)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W012-panther.png" >
            <p>
                Entertaining enough and worth seeing if only for it's cultural
                significance; mild slapstick and physical comedy; the classic
                theme tune; and of course, Sellers' performance. What struck me the 
                most was how little 'detectorising' actually takes place and the
                ending is oddly unsatisfying by modern story-telling standards
                (it is a farce so playing against genre conventions 
                is to be excpected and to this extent it was interesting to see).
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>A Shot in the Dark</em> (1964)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W012-dark.png" >
            <p>
                <em>A Shot in the Dark</em> hits you with a great
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28NEnqI-g5o">opening theme</a>
                as we witness the central crime plays out using an interesting
                sort of style that lets us look through the windows of apartment 
                rooms in a sort of <em>Rear Window</em> fashion before the title 
                credits play.
            </p>
            <p>
                It continues the same mild wit and the bumbling and stumbling Clouseau
                from the first film but with more of the conventional trappings
                of a detective story (interviewing witnesses, 
                <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummationGathering">assembling all of the suspects in one room</a> 
                to finally reveal the murderer).
            </p>
            <p>
                It's interesting to note that it came out in the same
                year as <em>Dr Strangelove</em> so if you
                are only interested in seeing one 1964 Peter Sellers film 
                then maybe shouldn't be this one.
            </p>

            
            <h2><em>The Return of the Pink Panther</em> (1975)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W012-return.png" >
            <p>
                Released eleven years after <em>A Shot in the Dark</em> (there
                was an interim Panther film made without Edwards or Sellers),
                <em>Return</em> sees Clouseau again looking to solve the theft 
                of the Pink Panther diamond by the notorious Phantom. The story-telling
                gets a bit long-in-the-tooth here. It's hard to really care about the
                solving of the mystery, but this film does has some great comedic
                set-pieces which make it at least fleetingly enjoyable. The 
                highlights of these set-pieces would have to be 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/vQ1B2FeDYoI">Insp. Clouseau's introduction</a>
                and his fights with his
                <a href="https://youtu.be/ghBY8dakqJ4">karate student: Cato</a>.
            </p>
            

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                Does Clouseau, as a character, live up to Sellers' characters 
                in Kubrick's <em>Lolita</em> or <em>Dr Strangelove</em>? Maybe
                not, but it is still a fun character who Sellers injects a lot
                of energy into in each of the films. Mancini's music and Edward's 
                direction are also both strong throughtout, too.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are only two other Pink Panther films that fit the <a href="../about.html">criteria</a> 
                for watching (<em>Revenge</em> and <em>Strikes Again</em>) so 
                they will have to probably have to be paired with another Sellers 
                or Edwards production to be included in a future week's viewing.
                <em>The Party</em> (1968) seems a good contender as it was both
                directed by Blake Edwards and stars Peter Sellers.
