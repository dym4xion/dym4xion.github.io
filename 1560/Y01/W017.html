            <h2><em>The Seduction of Mimi</em> (1972)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W017-mimi.png" >
            <p>  
                <em>Mimi</em> has a real respect for dialogue but can still do a
                lot even in it's less dialogue heavy scenes. It's more 
                lighthearted in tone rather than consistently laugh out loud
                funny but it does have one or two particularly outrageous 
                moments.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's hard to not be constantly aware of how <b>Italian</b> it is 
                (maybe this is part of the satire) especially when it has
                <a href="https://youtu.be/4mx407UflJQ">a scene</a> 
                composed almost entirely of hand gestures.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's arguably very out of date on certain topics, but why 
                wouldn't it be? It features a one particularly brutal scene of 
                spousal abuse that is so horiffic that I feel safe in 
                assuming that it must be some sort of commentary.
            </p>

            <h2><em>Love &amp; Anarchy</em> (1973)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W017-anarchy.png" >
            <p>
                Giannini, Melato and Fiore are just as entertaining here as they
                were in <em>Mimi</em> but Lina Polito also shines in her role as
                Tripolina. It can be quite meandering but the meandering is fun
                and the third act redeems any slowness felt in the first two. 
            </p>

            <h2><em>Seven Beauties</em> (1975)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W017-beauties.png" >
            <p>
                Giancarlo Giannini is more isolated in this story in a sense
                but he has enough range to hold the focus that the film wants to
                maintain on Pasqualino. What is sorely missed is a more
                robust counter to his character that we get from Mariangela 
                Melato in the previous two films. The upporting cast is good 
                though especially Elena Fiore who, as far as I can tell, is the
                only other person to feature in all three films along G.G.. 
                Ultimately, though, the disjuncted nature of the film prohibits
                any real intimate look at a supporting character which would in
                turn tell us more about Giannini's character.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <a href="https://youtu.be/Mx2GoEV5yf0">war montage intro</a>
                is pretty interesting and does a good job of setting the tone for the
                rest of the film which features some brutal concentration camp 
                scenes interspersed with scenes of the main character before 
                he was captured such that its non-linear telling eventually 
                gives the whole story. Perhaps in this respect the film works
                best as a dramatic character study of Pasqualino with some 
                comedic elements rather than an outright comedy. It can feel like
                it escapes categorisation but maybe it perfectly fits the 
                category of 'black comedy' and that maybe there are components of the
                film that can't be properly translated through subtitles.
                Maybe there is a greater point to be made about how tragedy is 
                somehow more univeral than comedy as there are some really
                instensly tragic scenes in this film, particularly towards the
                end.
            </p>
            <p>
                An interesting unintended coincidence to note is how
                <span class="spoiler">similar it ends to the ending of last
                weeks final film <em>Ascent</em></span>.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                Three overtly political comedies(?) mostly centering around the
                themes of anarchism and fascism in Italy. Wertmüller does a 
                good job of getting good performances out of her cast and the 
                direction generally is inventive and works well to keep the story
                moving throughout all three. My favourite would probably be 
                <em>Love & Anrachy</em> which is probably why I have so little
                to say about it. <em>Mimi</em> is fun too, but I would have a 
                hard time fully recommending <em>Seven Beauties</em>; not 
                because it isn't good (it is) but purely out of how 
                uncomfortable it can be to watch I can understand that many 
                may not enjoy watching it, but it is provoking nonetheless.
