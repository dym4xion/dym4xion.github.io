            <h1>W001: Costa-Gavras</h1>
            <p>Week starting: 2020-09-21</p>


            <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3IinKq1LaQ"><em>Z</em> (1969)</a></h2>
            <img src="imgs/W001/z.png" >
            <p>
                <em>Z</em> works well as a film largely through it's ability to take 
                what could otherwise be a fairly simple story of politically motivated
                assassination and relate it to very human experiences in an 
                engaging way. The film very much lives 
                up to its many acolades. Its punchy editing and 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvfqjaGiBec">music</a>  which won
                Academy and BAFTA awards (respectively) help keep the film alive
                and its political commentary still rings coherently
                today despite being over 50 years old.
            </p>
            <p>
                Retelling the story of the assassination of the Greek politician
                Grigoris Lambrakis, but this time (for political reasons) set in
                Algieria, <em>Z</em>  does a great job of avoiding straying into 
                the exaggarated or hyperbolic too frequently. Instead it is able
                to use brief moments of humour or violence when following the 
                murder investigation in a way that more realistically reflects 
                our own world. My favourite scenes would have to be the ones 
                which follow 'The Judge' and his relatively cooly conducted investigation. 
                The way in which the local officials and agitators try their 
                best to wiggle their way out any responsiblity or accountability
                is astutely depicted and at times nothing short of hilarious.
            </p>
            <p>
                I really enjoyed how the ending was executed, primarily for how
                it escapes the trap of ending either too sentimentally or too
                pessimistically. It ends aptly, if somewhat irreverently, for a film that
                has an especially authentic perspective on the consequences of 
                systemic corruption.

            <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ykE9ABSyo"><em>The Confession</em>  (1970)</a></h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W001/confession.png" >
            <p> 
                <em>The Confession</em> continues Gavra's work in poltitical
                thrillers and while this film may be less fun to watch than 
                <em>Z</em> it is just as impactful in its presentation. Like
                <em>Z</em>, <em>The Confession</em> adapts a real story, this time
                the story of Czechoslovak communist politician Artur London
                and the torture he endured to obtain a coerced confession for a 
                show trial.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I found most interesting about this film is that, whether
                intentionally or not, it functions very well as a demonstration
                of the idea of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_religion#Political_religion">politics-as-religion</a>.
                Throughout the film there are several references to having 
                'faith' in the party; in certain rooms there are portraits
                of Stalin and Gottwald (functioning as <a href="https://library.ryerson.ca/asc/2015/03/leninism-as-political-religion/">icons</a>); and, most 
                glaringly, the title of the film and its main subject matter 
                point to the act of confession: a component of the 
                Sacrament of Reconciliation in the Catholic Church. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond religious subtext, <em>The Confession</em> is still a 
                great insight into authoritarianism, and really let's us 
                sympathise with its characters.

            <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-JQIGh_kAM"><em>State of Siege</em> (1973)</a></h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W001/siege.png" >
            <p>
                <em>State of Siege</em> features great <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDn-d8_8zj4">music</a>
                from Mikis Theodorakis, who also did the music for <em>Z</em>.
                Rather than assassination or torture, this film looks closely at
                a group of rebels looking to gain leverage over the US backed 
                Uruguayan government through kidnapping public officials. The film
                does a great job of expressing the rage felt towards US regime 
                change action in Latin America as well the moral quandaries faced
                by rebels.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interestingly, when watching <em>State of Siege</em> I was
                reminded of a quote at the end of 
                <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-confession-1971">Roger Ebert's review of <em>The Confession</em></a>
                where he brings up the point that anti-war activist Daniel Berrigan
                addresses in an open letter to the Weathermen that "no cause was 
                worth the sacrifice of a single human life". I think this critique
                of martydom is something that can be seen throughout each of the
                films seen this week, in that as much as some of the characters 
                may try to achieve their goals, they are ultimately subjected to
                factors outside of their control.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2> 
            <p>
                These films do not only share a director but also are related 
                through the performance of Yves Montand, who plays central 
                characters in each of the films. He gives a solid performances
                with his role in <em>The Confession</em> being the most
                impressive. However, I think it wouldn't be too controversial 
                to say that there is not much range in each of these characters
                with each of them being a public official of some kind - in such 
                a way that they are fairly interchangeable (aesthetically, not 
                politically).
            </p>
            <p>
                Moreso, I think these films work well together as they each tap
                into a real sense of frustration and unfairness, particularly 
                within a political context, that has a universal appeal. Despite
                grappling with what can be fairly complex subject matters, these
                films are nonetheless easy to follow and fun to watch.
