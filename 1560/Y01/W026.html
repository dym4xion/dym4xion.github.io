            <h1>W026: John Carpenter</h1>
            <p>Week starting: 2021-03-15</p>


            <h2><em>Dark Star</em> (1974)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W026-star.png" >
            <p>
                Featuring some very inventive low budget SFX, <em>Dark Star</em>
                is, at times, very funny and generally is as effective as a
                satire of <em>2001</em> as <em>Spaceballs</em> is of <em>Star 
                Wars</em>, if less flashy and outwardly silly.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Assault on Precinct 13</em> (1976)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W026-13.png" >
            <p>
                Textbook John Carpenter. If it's not his best film, then it's
                definitely the one with the best soundtrack!
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Eyes of Laura Mars</em> (1978)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W026-mars.png" >
            <p>
                Faye Dunaway steals the show in this one, and fair enough! She's 
                definitely got the chops to carry the the story and the film
                only really drags in the scenes in which she is not in.
                Carpenter should be commended for his skills as a screen-writer
                and story teller and while this one lacks his usual playful
                style and music (he didn't direct or score it) it still ends up
                being a half-way decent premonition thriller film in a similar
                sort of vein as <em>Final Destination</em> or <em>Minority 
                Report</em>. What should you do when you foresee someone's
                death?

                I only really inlcuded it this week as I've already seen all the 
                other major Carpenter films pre-'81. It features a
                <a href="https://youtu.be/kgBAZRDiYfs">decent original song</a>,
                however.

            <p>
                Knapp's cinematography and
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbKzqBPK3C8&list=OLAK5uy_kBUA2WM3cG4ApSXwoEHFD04K5lIyJDB-E">Carptenter's music</a>
                featured in the
                first two films this week are what set them appart from
                <em>Laura Mars</em> and consequently makes this week's third
                film feel much less exciting in comparison, despite it's
                ambition.
