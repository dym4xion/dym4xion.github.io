            <h1>W019: Yasujiro Ozu</h1>
            <p>Week starting: 2021-01-25</p>


            <h2><em>Late Spring</em> (1949)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W019-spring.png" >
            <p>
                Beautifully ordinary and packed full of a certain kind of charm.
                Arguably as good as <em>Tokyo Story</em> even if not as widely 
                celebrated.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Tokyo Story</em> (1953)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W019-story.png" >
            <p>
                Isn't life disappointing?
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>An Autumn Afternoon</em> (1962)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W019-afternoon.png" >
            <p>
                The use of colour is well considered and the urban photography
                interstitials are strikingly beautiful, too.
                Obvious plot similarities to <em>Late Spring</em>
                but with a greater focus on the father and his friendships with
                his former classmates and teacher - a closer examination of masculinity to this 
                extent.

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2> 
            <p>
                A smarter person may have chosen to report on the 
                <a href="https://cinemaniacsjournal.blogspot.com/2016/11/yasujiro-ozu-noriko-trilogy.html">'Noriko Trilogy'</a>:
                an informal collection of three Ozu films (two 
                featured this week) where Setsuko Hara plays a character named
                Noriko but I wasn't aware of this until about halfway through 
                the week and it seemed to me the association between the films
                is informal enough and non-narrative based that it wouldn't be 
                a problem.  
            </p>
            <p>
                What I like most about all of these films is their most obvious
                quality. That is their fairly quiet and reflective demeanor 
                and the ability to use this to approach interesting social 
                problems of the time in a nuanced way. When the topic of Japan's
                role in the Second World War comes up in <em>An Autumn Afternoon</em>, 
                the conversation is relatively uncontroversial and 
                appropriately dispassionate such that after the protagonist
                (who was a captain of a destroyer) says "but I think
                it's good we lost", not much else needs to be discussed. This 
                reserved and realist approach seems to me to provide an
                insightful framework for exploring social topics like the 
                changing expectations of women in society and the treatment of 
                the elderly by their children and Ozu coordinates this well in a
                way that is neither too obscure nor overt.

                These films are so expressive of certain human qualities that 
                they almost don't warrant too close an examination into their 
                more technical attributes. I feel as if
                they are best enjoyed when not over analysed but simply looked 
                at and appreciated for the moments they strike in you a strong 
                sense of relatability or profundity. I think that is part of the
                reason I really don't have much to say about each one in 
                particular and also part of the reason why I can't help but...
