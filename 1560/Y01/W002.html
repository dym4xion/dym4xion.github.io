            <h2><em>A Fistful of Dollars</em> (1964)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W002/dollars1.png" >
            <p>
                I think what I like most about <em>A Fistful of Dollars</em> 
                (AFOD) is how simple it is. You can easily see where the
                plot is going early on in the film, but that doesn't 
                detract too much from the ability to enjoy the it. Instead
                of a heady plot or high concept ideas, what AFOD offers
                is a series of fun set pieces, set to great music.
            </p>
            <p>
                It makes sense that the plot of the film isn't its proudest
                achievement, given that it rips off the plot of Akira 
                Kurosawa's <em>Yojimbo</em> (1961) (see next week). However, that isn't 
                to say that AFOD's other components are not an artistic 
                achievement in themself. Leone establishes here a 
                <b>style</b> here that is carried out and developed
                throughout the rest of this week's films and, in turn,
                will go on to influence many other films. This style
                isn't appreciated by anyone moreso than Quentin Tarantino
                who really encorporates a lot of Leone into his own films
                as he describes in <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/shooting-star">this</a> 
                article in the Spectator.

            <h2><em>For a Few Dollars More</em> (1965)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W002/dollars2.png" >
            <p>
                <em>For a Few Dollars More</em> (FAFDM) sees Eastwood and 
                Volonte returning as <s>the same</s> totally different
                characters, but this time they are joined by Lee Van Cleef's
                Colonel Mortimer, who does a great job of introducing a third
                perspective to the film of a competing-bounty-hunter-turned-accomplice to
                Eastwood's Man with No Name. The film develops what 
                AFOD established in a really interesting way that leaves you satisfied
                by the end. Even though I think it's the best of the three films (see notes),
                I don't have much to add other than it's a lot of fun to watch
                and everything that was great about the previous film returns here
                in full force.

            <h2><em>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</em> (1966)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W002/dollars3.png" >
            <p>
                <em>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</em> (GBU) is a much bigger
                film than the two that preceed it - by almost every measure.
                Despite being around an hour longer than AFOD, GBU is still as
                ennjoyable, and rarely feels as if it is dragging. Even some of
                the more minute scenes that don't contribute much to the plot are
                enjoyable to watch. I think this must be due to how lightweight
                the central plot is. It really can be summarised as "go to this place 
                to find the hidden gold". As such, you only need to care about the
                plot to the extent that it lets you experience the antics of the three main
                characters. The American Civil War features quite significantly 
                in the film and the subject is handled in a surprisingly deft way.
            </p>
            <p>
                Something that occurred to me early on in the film was that there 
                are probably quite a few people who have seen GBU without first seeing
                the other two, due to this film's greater success. I wonder how 
                much this affects how much you enjoy the film as I remember several
                years ago trying, and failing, to sit through all of GBU but this
                time I was much more up for it and it didn't feel as much of
                a drag as I remember from my first attempt watching it.

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2> 
            <p>
                One of these film's most distinguishing characteristics 
                is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyoL8qk0sVSuI2Qe5PV2SxPn7gJddPPYD">Ennio Morricone's score</a>.
                I don't know enough about music to say exactly why the
                score is so good, but what I think is most special about
                the score is how directly it is tied in with what we are
                seeing on screen. This audio/visual harmony, I think, is 
                what allows these films to be 'meaningful' without needing 
                to say much. Instead of long monologues or other devices 
                that may be used to direct the viewer's attention to a specific point the film is making, the way 
                music and videography is combined expresses something far 
                more ephemeral but no less human or fun to watch.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my money, FAFDM is the best of the three and probably 
                works best as a stand alone film. I'm not certain I would
                have enjoyed AFOD as much if I didn't know there was more
                of the same to come. Equally, I don't think I would have
                enjoyed GBU without first seeing it's predecessors which 
                engaged me with, and made me hungrier for Leone's filmmaking.
                FAFDM, however, stands out for me as a film that strikes 
                the best balance for what these films are trying to do, 
                whereas GBU (which is generally taken to be the pinacle of
                these films) is sometimes too meandering and AFOD is ultimately less impactful.

                of why it is the better film, so read that for more on this point.

                Finally, I wanted to include an interesting point made by 
                YouTube commenter John Maddin made under the a clip of the
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onjt2L2lDEY">final scene of FAFDM</a>: 
                "I always found it funny that these movies were bankrolled 
                by German money, shot in Spain, directed by an Italian with
                mostly Italian actors who spoke next to no English with 
                just the one or two American actors and these spaghetti 
                movies were the first to depict a more realistic and 
                believable Old West, before this an American western starred
                John Wayne or Randolph Scott and were totally devoid of 
                realism and the dirt, hardship and the general nitty gritty 
                of the wild west. The spaghetti westerns were the first that
                felt more believable".
