            <p>Week starting: 2021-02-22</p>


            <h2><em>The Birds</em> (1963)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W023-birds.png" >
            <p>
              Mechanically, <em>The Birds</em> functions in the same way in 
              which all good zombie films do in that there is a nice slow build
              that provides the background environment which is then corrupted 
              by an extreme cataclysm. Furthering this, it even features the 
              standard zombie film trope whereby the cast of characters, when
              confronted by the intitial violence, must discuss the best course
              of action where one voice is a skeptic, the one or two people who
              actually experienced the attack appear as hysterical, and then 
              perhaps one or two people accept the apparent hysteria has 
              sincere concern. Finally on this, once the main cast has
              successfully evaded the swarm they end up finding themselves
              attempting to develop a fortified stronghold anticipating
              further attacks. Such tropes serve only as a testament to <em>The
              Birds</em>' influence (but also Vincent Price's <em>Last Man on
              Earth</em> and, later, the George Romero films) on modern zombie
              films and television.

              Contained in this film is also all of the ususal psychological 
              intrigue you would expect from a Hitchcock thriller like <em>Rear
              Window</em> (1954) or <em>Vertigo</em> (1958) and in my mind is 
              just as effective as those two, even if less highly celebrated.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Kes</em> (1969)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W023-kes.png" >
            <p>
              Dai Bradley's performance is commendable if not only for his
              acting then his kestrel handling skills too. As such the training 
              scenes with the bird are some of the most enjoyable in the film
              and are a nice break from the otherwise difficult life faced by
              Billy and his family.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</em> (1973)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W023-seagull.png" >
            <p>
              Did you know that there is 
              <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/natureuk/entries/4cbc654d-9478-4091-8a9c-d03183957e60">no such thing as a Seagull</a>?
              That is: there is no one specific species that is identified by 
              the name 'Seagull' but that there are several species of gull many
              of which live by the sea. It is the material qualities of 
              <em>Jonathan Livingston Seagull</em> (like the material qualities
              of the Common gull or the Great black-backed gull) that set it
              apart from other films. I don't think <em>JLS</em> has anything
              that interesting to say, rather the impressions the film left 
              on me, in terms of its sights and sounds, are significant; and
              in watching it you may end up asking yourself questions like:
              how did they get all those birds to do that? or: wow doesn't that
              look beautiful? To this extent, because the story is so 
              ridiculous, I think a better film could be edited using the same
              material
              (<a href="https://youtu.be/mgkk0Hdwmo8">the great Neil Diamond songs</a>, 
              select pieces of the hushed voice-over
              dialogue, beautiful gull cinematography) to make a more
              experimental montage art film expressing the hardships of everday
              gulls; rather than the strange new-age messianic story it tries to
              sell. Maybe some sort of
              <a href="https://www.cbr.com/better-fan-movie-edits/">fan-edit</a> 
              is warranted.

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2> 
            <p>
              Despite it being the least appreciated - or rather: the most hated
              - <em>JLS</em> has, for some reason, captured my attention more
              than the other two this week. I think because <em>The Birds</em> 
              and <em>Kes</em> are so obviously good and <em>JLS</em> is
              so obviously bad (but in a strange way very technically
              impressive) that falling into the rabbit hole of how and why <em>
              JLS</em> was made has proved quite interesting. The best source
              I've found on this is the video
