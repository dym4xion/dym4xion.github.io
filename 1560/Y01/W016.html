            <h2><em>Wings</em> (1966)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W016-wings.png" >
            <p>
                <em>Wings</em> is a nice look at the often re-visited topic
                of military service personnel adapting to civilian life but this time in an
                environment less often portrayed. Its merits are its understatedness
                yet social and interpersonal astuteness (the awkward first time 
                meeting between our main character and their son-in-law
                is feels uncannily real). At its heart it seems to look at the lasting 
                social tensions caused by the war: but at a mostly personal level. 
                Nadya feels astranged from her adopted daughter and as her
                recollection of her time at war strengthens, it is at the cost of 
                her ability to relate moreso to her peacetime comrades.
                None of this, however, is without a robust, if reserved, sense of
                humour and stylisically sound photography.  
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>You and Me</em> (1971)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W016-me.png" >
            <p>
                In <em>You and Me</em> Shepitko continues the sort of calm
                realist drama she sets out in <em>Wings</em> with a similar
                sort of dialogue style that does a great job of showing (rather
                than telling) us what the characters are like. The themes explored
                in this one are maybe a bit more cerebral than those of <em>Wings</em>,
                in that it looks more at ephermeral qualities of mental dispositions
                and tries to capture that using the textural qualities of what can
                be done on film. For such a diffcult task, the results are quite
                cogent even if it is a little meandering and hard to follow in the
                beginning.
                This is largely rectified by its visual strikingness and competency 
                (the circus scene is a great technical achievement) also it 
                possesses a great sense of charm that is well conveyed in some
                thoughtfully drawn out scenes.

            <h2><em>Ascent</em> (1977)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W016-ascent.png" >
            <p>
                I find that <em>The Ascent</em> really speaks for itself so I don't really know 
                what of any value I could say about it. It is technically very
                good and Shepitko does a good job of transferring what was so 
                good about the previous two films (the reservedness, the realism)
                into a radically different setting. All the brutality of the
                Russian experience of the war is here, and Shepitko's deftness
                for portraying cinematically how real people behave only makes
                it more heartbreaking. It's totally gripping and totally immersive 
                thanks to some really great performances and outdoor locations. 
            </p>
            
            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2> 
            <p>
                Nothing really to add. Each are good examples of maybe what could
                be called 'quiet cinema' as they are very impactful and achieve
                a lot but without any exaggarated drama or over stylisation. These are some very 
                real feeling stories that are told well and in such a way that it respects it's audience.
                I'd like to see her other major film: <em>Heat</em> (1962) 
                (her first feature), but I haven't been able to find it anywhere online.
