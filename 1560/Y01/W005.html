            <h2><em>It Always Rains on Sunday</em> (1947)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W005-sunday.png" >
            <p>
                Less a crime film as much as it is a family drama/slice-of-life
                providing an interesting insight on how people lived in the few years after 
                the war, complete with: Anderson shelters, rations books, haddock for breakfast, 
                and baths in the kitchen. As pointed out in 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5b4Pkl1JgFM">this BFI clip</a>
                it's sort of a protogentic soap opera or kitchen sink drama, so it's interesting
                to watch in that respect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interesting analysis 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De4PZNeRYEM">here</a> too.
            </p>

            <h2><em>Brighton Rock</em> (1948)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W005-rock.png" >
            <p>
                Interwar setting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The highlight of the film has to be Richard Attenborough's 
                sinister mob youth 'Pinkie' but also great stuff from
                Hermione Baddeley too.
            </p>
            <p>
                Theological components.
            </p>
            <p>
                Surprisingly violent.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>The Blue Lamp</em> (1950)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W005-lamp.png" >
            <p>
                Has more of a focus on the workings of the police: the story 
                following a new copper in a city with "homes broken and demoralised by war".
            </p>
            <p>
                It's realism can be a bit mundane and it was one of the harder films to get a 
                nice cinematic screenshot for the heading image. Could imagine
                it having a spin off TV programme; it's quite reserved in its 
                attempt to portray police life in a mostly positive light.
            </p>
            <p>
                More interesting analysis 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCUBXVkqeBE">here</a>
                than I could give.

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                With each of these films clocking in at around 90 minutes, I 
                thought that it would be a good idea to try to watch all of 
                the films back-to-back and see how that would effect the
                experience. I don't think I will be trying it again; I think
                it's better to watch one, think about it for a day or two, 
                then watch the next - if only so that I end up having more 
                to say about each film.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm not sure I could fully recommend any of these films as
                films that must be seen in the same way I could recommend
                Kurosawa's or Lean's films from the past few weeks, but they 
                are <b>entertaining enough</b> and not too long. Which makes
                me wonder whether I have been spoiling myself in the previous
                four weeks with highly regarded classics. It stands to reason
                that across 1560 films made before 1981, that not all of them
                are going to be earth-shatteringly revelatory and exciting films.
                Plenty of them will be just OK.
