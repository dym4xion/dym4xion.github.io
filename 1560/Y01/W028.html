            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                They are as much Noel Coward's and Ronald Neame's films as they
                are David Lean's but Lean's direction is nonetheless punchy and
                quick witted. As well as this, we see in each of these the two
                basic features which make a 'Lean' film so good: great
                characters and a great story. I put each of these very close to
                (but just short of) <em>Brief Encounter</em>, with <em>This
                Happy Breed</em> perhaps coming the closest. We're treated here
                to returning performances by Celia Johnson and John Mills in the 
                first two. All round great fun that I'm sure will stick in my
                head for a good while.
