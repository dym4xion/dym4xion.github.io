            <h1>W032: Indefinite Hiatus</h1>
            <p>Week starting: 2021-04-26</p>


            <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjs5zfxDMs"><em>Walking the Streets of Moscow</em> (1967)</a></h2>
            <img src="imgs/W032-moscow.png" >
            <p>
                A nice light-hearted comedy drama mainly following three
                Muscovite youths and one Siberian youth passing through Moscow
                and the antics they get up to in a day. Its plot is as listless
                as its characters but that's not so important when it has as
                much charm and optimism as it does. 
            </p>
            
            
            <h2><em>The Color of Pomegranates</em> (1969)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W032-pomegranates.png" >
            <p>
                A very visually striking film but it otherwise escapes any intelligent
                dicussion from me. I really don't know enough about traditional
                Armenian culture or the film's biographic subject to make much of a comment about it in these
                regards. Its images are really quite arresting though which makes
                up for the lack of any apparent narrative. I can imagine people
                who like stories hating this, but people who like more visual
                art mediums (painting, photography) loving it. I'm moreso in the
                middle but have great respect for it. 
            </p>

            
            <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B3nK-k0KzQ"><em>Unbelievable Adventures of Italians in Russia</em> (1974)</a></h2>
            <img src="imgs/W032-russia.png" >
            <p>
                A <em>Rat Race</em> (2001) style hunt for hidden treasure
                burried somewhere in Moscow featuring a traffic law obiding
                lion, a magic flying cigar and lots of well choreographed
                stunts. Not always laugh out loud funny but it definitely has
                its moments.

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                Since taking up full-time employment over the past three
                weeks, it has been a lot harder to crank out a post before the
                end of each Sunday about three films I have watched throughout
                the week. As such, I am reading much less than I would like to
                be and therefore the project is going on hold. I have found it
                great fun exploring films both niche and world famous from the 
                earlier two thirds of cinema's history. Less-so feeling an
                eagerness to watch new films, I am more excited in the months 
                ahead to watching films at a much slower pace. I really think
                it's possible that I have been spoiling myself with watching so
                many good films in such quick succession.
            </p>

                Nothing really connects these films other than that they were
                made in the Soviet Union. I only chose them as three that may 
                make up a decent final set of films that I could watch
                all of and write about in a day.
                I'm thinking: when (or if) I return to this project I will maybe
                change the rules so that I can rewatch films I have already
                seen, so long as I haven't seen it for the blog. Till then.
