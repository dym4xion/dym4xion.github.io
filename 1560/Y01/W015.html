            <p>Week starting: 2020-12-28</p>


            <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIWW4tUlkm4"><em>Something Different</em> (1963)</a></h2>
            <img src="imgs/W015-different.png" >
            <p>
                A wonderfully simple slice-of-life contrasting the lived 
                experiences of a small family and the difficulties that come 
                with marriage and parenthood against a professional gymnast as 
                she trains for her final competition. In both stories there is 
                a searching for (you guessed it) something different in their
                every-day lives. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I think the gymnasts training is the highlight for me.
                it's fascinating to watch and gives such weight to how the 
                competition is experienced too.
                The home-setting scenes are good too and contain what you would 
                likely expect from a social realist picture: children messing 
                around; cooking and cleaning; feeding pets; bedtime stories;
                forgetting why you walkd into a room; affairs; habitual boredom;
                straightening picture frames.
            </p>
            
            <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ0lkjPbOlk"><em>Daisies</em> (1966)</a></h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W015-daisies.png" >
            <p>
                Because it's so outwardly silly, <em>Daisies</em> may be one of
                the most accesssible experimental films I have yet to see. It's
                near total irreverance, however, doesn't lessen to any extent
                the quite serious statement it contains - rather you get to
                enjoy what it has to say in this altogether freaky, quirky,
                and often hilarious trip of a film proporting it's fairly 
                cogent anti-war message.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Panelstory</em> (1980)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W015-panelstory.png" >
            <p>
                Continuing the slice-of-life social realism of <em>Something 
                Different</em>, <em>Panelstory</em> looks closer 
                <a href="https://translate.yandex.com/?from=tabbar&text=Panelstory%20aneb%20Jak%20se%20rod%C3%AD%20s%C3%ADdliste&lang=cs-en">(as it's full title would suggest)</a>
                at the creation of a 
                new residential apartment block area and the communities that 
                spring from that. It's greatest merit is how transportive it is.
                In the way we see the characters interact with each other and
                their surroundings it's easy to feel as if you are experiencing 
                common everyday life in socialist Czechoslovakia is such a way
                more immersive than what you would be able to attain just by 
                reading its history. Whether or not this is an authentic 
                portrayal, I have no idea, but I assume that it can't be too
                far off as it doesn't overly romanticise the experience and
                well addresses lacking healthcare and childcare services.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                There is an experimental edge contained in each of the films,
                even the more realist dramas. In the upside down training scene
                from <em>Something Different</em> I feel as if we see the vein
                of the creative idiosyncrasies we get in <em>Daisies</em>; which,
                in turn, isn't totally lost in the plainer <em>Panelstory</em>
                as through the sort of meditative interstitials of of the 
                concrete panels being assembled into apartment blocks, we get 
                a reminder of the sort of scrap book montage art-style that
                <em>Daisies</em> uses to a much more radical degree.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first it is hard to track how one director could make 
                such seemingly disparate films, but nonetheless there are
                very distinct commonalities: chiefly being, portraying the experience
                of young women within this particular period of time (60s/70s) 
                in this particular place on Earth (Czechoslovakia) likely then
                reflecting Chytilová's own experiences and as such we seen her
                interesting sensibilities come through on screen.

                /* It's been a busy week this week so I probably haven't written 
                as much as I would like to. I'm experimenting with new techniques
                with writing and am finding that it easier to try to spread writing
                out as much as I can across the whole week rather than trying to
                watch the films throughout the week and cramming writing into the
                weekend. I tried this for the first time last week and it seemed
                to work better at creating at least more words on the page. Whether
                they are of better quality - who knows! */
