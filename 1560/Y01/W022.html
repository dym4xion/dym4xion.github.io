            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2> 
            <p>
                The first two follow a sort of <b>wrong man</b> character caught
                up in a situation more thrilling than what they are used to,
                whereas the seccond is a more conventional Spy vs. Spy thriller.
                Peter Lorre is particularly charismatic in <em>Secret
                Agent</em> and <em>TMWKTM</em>, however <em>The 39 Steps</em>
                stands out as the better film and I found it to be the most 
                engaging out of the three. What doesn't go unnoticed in these
                three is how modern they feel, and this makes me wonder
                whether Hitchcock was ahead of his time or moreso just highly 
                influential. Who can say for sure?
