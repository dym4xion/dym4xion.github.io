            <p>Week starting: 2020-12-14</p>


            <h2><em>Trouble in Paradise</em> (1932)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W013-paradise.png" >
            <p>
                <em>Trouble in Paradise</em>'s direction is strikingly modern
                for a film that is 88 years old. The ending is equal parts 
                tragic and ecstatic. Strong performances from leads and supporting
                cast.
            </p>

            
            <h2><em>Ninotchka</em> (1939)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W013-ninotchka.png" >
            <p>
                Featuring a litany of decent performances, the best of which
                coming from the three wacky, luxury seeking commisars, 
                <em>Ninotchka</em> feels both (sometimes at the same time)
                cynical and lighthearted. Cynical towards its characters who seem
                to have strongly held convictions, and lightearted about
                their willingness or tendency to change.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it really wanted to be a smart satire it would be able to 
                make fun of both state ideolodies at the same time or at least have 
                a better sense of the tragic like 2017's <em>The Death of Stalin</em>.
                Something about it's use in the 1947 <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=&quot;what+licked+us+was+ninotchka&quot;">Italian elections</a> 
                would suggest its less-than-honest-to-goodness filmmaking intentions.
                You would have to be a staunch individualist to truly love it.
            </p>
            

            <h2><em>The Shop Around the Corner</em> (1940)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W013-corner.png" >
            <p>
                Jimmy Stewart is as competant as ever in one of his earliest
                performances I have seen him in, <em>The Shop Around the 
                Corner</em> also features an equally 
                strong performance from his co-star Margaret Sullavan.
                While the two take center stage, that shouldn't detract
                from the really exceptional interpersonal dynamics between
                the shop's employees which is what really sets the film
                apart. It's a warm and saccarine but far less ideologically 
                on-the-nose film than <em>Ninotchka</em> and more honorable 
                than <em>Trouble in Paradise</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The manipulation of Novak by Kralik as he realises first
                 their mutual coincidence is, of course
                by modern standards, unfashionable and uncomfortable but it
                does a decent enough job of evading being totally sadistic.
                Unintentionally (on my part), it also functions somewhat as a 
                Christmas film so if you are looking for one to watch then 
                this is one.
            </p>
            

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                All three are perfectly enjoyable films.
                <em>Trouble in Paradise</em> and <em>The Shop Around the
                Corner</em> stand out for me, <em>Ninotchka</em> lacks the
                subtlety of the other two.
