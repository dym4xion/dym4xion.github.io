            <h1>W011: Chantal Akerman</h1>
            <p>Week starting: 2020-11-30</p>


            <h2><em>Je Tu Il Elle</em> (1974)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W011-elle.png" >
            <p>
                Maybe the most simple of the three, <em>Je Tu Il Elle</em> does
                a lot with very little. Akerman proves here to be very 
                competent at acting as well as writing/directing.
                It goes without saying that it is ambitious for its time,
                or even by today's standards, as such it's not for the prudish.
            
            <h2><em>Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du commerce, 1080 Bruxelles</em> (1975)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W011-bruxelles.png" >
            <p>
                Definitely unlike anything I have seen, <em>Jeanne Dielman</em>
                does away with complex story or conventional framing in exchange for 
                bucket-loads of subtlety and 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brvk5JsQFEU">interesting cinematography</a> 
                to portray three days in the life
                of it's main character.
                If you want a nice synopsis, who better to give one than
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY59Ph2L0N0">Akerman herself</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Time is important in this film. The three days roughly equally break up the three
                hour runtime but we only see the second half and first half of the
                first and third days (respectively) so why is the second day compressed?
                Maybe it means something, maybe it doesn't, but Ivone Margulies gives an
                interesting analysis of the film over

            </p>


            <h2><em>Les Rendez-vous d'Anna</em> (1978)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W011-anna.png" >
            <p>
                Here we have some strong performances from all included but 
                Aurore Cl√©ment as Anna stands out with a great understanding and 
                use of subtle expressions and reactions that can tell far more than 
                anything that can be written or said. Nonetheless the writing is still fantastic
                and we are lucky here to be afforded so much more of Akerman's great
                dialogue writing than what is featured in the previous two films.
            </p>


            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                In their reserved styles these films force us to ask questions about
                what is going on. Questions for which there may be no answers. Who is the
                Tu in <em>Je Tu Il Elle</em>? Why do the potatoes get overcooked on the 
                second day of <em>Jeanne Dielman</em>? What does Anna want in 
                <em>Les Rendez-vous d'Anna</em>?
            </p>
            <p>
                Some further commonalities between these films include a great 
                sensibility for set dressing, especially in <em>Jeanne Dielman</em>.
                I would love to be able to walk around that set to get a closer look
                at the all the small things that bring that appartment to life. A further
                commonality is the introspective/autobiographical quality. When we
                see Jeanne or Anna's loneliness or lacking sense of belonging
                it would seem to be Akerman's own feelings we see too.
            </p>            
            <p>
                As with any film that reaches to do something experimental, the more
                you 'go with' these films the more you will 'get out' of them.
                I found <em>Les Rendez-vous d'Anna</em> to be the most 'accessible'
                of the three, by which I mean that it's probably the least experimental,
                or even the least ambitious, but I think it's the most deftly presented
                and the most enjoyable under conventional standards.
