            <h2><em>Ivan's Childhood</em> (1962)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W014-childhood.png" >
            <p>
                <em>Ivan's Childhood</em> would be a lot harder to watch if
                it wasn't so visually striking. While it's a gloomy situation our
                characters find themselves in, the drawn out meditative shots of 
                flooded forests or derelict buildings do embody a sense of
                contemplative serentity that can let you forget that a war
                is going on. Not in the background, but not always in the
                forground either; it's the effects of the war that Tarkovsky 
                is more interested in here, rather than the war in-and-of-itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The depictions of battlefield horrors faced by children (or in 
                this case <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0G35VQvyDc">a</a> child) on the Eastern front is a theme it shares
                with the later Belarusian film <em>Come and See</em> (1985) known widely 
                for it's intense portrayal of the subject. Insomuch as they can, or should,
                be compared I think that <em>Ivan's Childhood</em> is more reserved
                and stylistcally superior but I think the two films are trying 
                to do two very different things - I only really use it as 
                a comparator as it's the closest thing I've seen with such
                obvious similarities. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Much of its visual successes can likely be credited to
                the film's director of photography 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqStjkq0vJ8">Vadim Yusov</a>
                who really leverages the qualities of the 1.33 aspect ratio
                and is able to both get up close in small sets as well as capture the height
                and airy-ness of more expansive landscapes. It's worth seeing on 
                as big a screen in as high a quality as you can! (this is probably true for
                each of this weeks films).

            <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsEnNDr6YfA"><em>Andrei Rublev</em> (1966)</a></h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W014-rublev.png" >
            <p>
                From only seeing <em>Solaris</em> and now <em>Ivan's Childhood</em>
                I would not have expected Tarkovsky to have made a historical epic
                that can compete with some of the greatest of the historical epic
                tradition; but in <em>Andrei Rublev</em> he pulls it off to an 
                excellent degree without losing any of the cerebral niceties that
                I have come to expect.
            </p>
            <p>
                Billed as a biographical film, it's reasons for being so great is that
                it precisely isn't! While Andrei Rublev is the central character in the
                story, more often than not he is sidelined by the more significant events
                that take place around him (a Tartar invasion, the casting of a bell).
                The end result, then, is a gorgeuosly painted look at medieval Russian
                life in the Tarkovsky style - and it's because of it's long run time, not 
                in spite of it, that it can be a really sublime piece of historical filmmaking
                with great compassionate and humanising streaks.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are once again graced with both Yusov's great cinematography
                and Nikolay Burlyaev's (Ivan from <em>Ivan's Childhood</em>) acting
                as the bell maker. It's interesting to note the differences and
                similarities across the two parts of <em>Andrei Rublev</em>. For this reason
                (and for the film's runtime) it's worth making use of the intermission.

            <h2><em>Stalker</em> (1979)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W014-stalker.png" >

            <p>
                The less you know about this film the better, so if you
                have even the slightest interest in this film you should 
                see it before reading anything else.
            </p>
            <p>
                Leaveraging sepia and colour photography to tell a story 
                taking place in two distinct worlds, <em>Stalker</em> is both
                unnerving and hard to take your eyes off of. With it's mind-bending
                unrealities and tranquil-yet-disturbed meditations on nature, 
                <em>Stalker</em>'s most obvious comparitor to me 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSNalp9shWc">(and I'm sure to many others)</a>
                seems to be 2018's <em>Annihilation</em>. The differences between
                the two are clear but what is fascinating about the similarities
                are that how what can be found unsettling in the human experience can be constant across
                even the most significant lines of separation. <em>Stalker</em> and
                <em>Annihilation</em> exist in two quite different social, political, 
                and geographic landscapes and yet the reasons why both are so
                unsettling are the same. They both invoke similar kinds of fear of the
                unknown; self-destructive tendencies; the human relationship to their
                environment; the idea of profoundly localised yet universal experiences;
                having seemingly concrete conceptions of the world peverted; and 
                crossing threasholds from which there is no return.

                is just as beautiful here as in 
                <em>Solaris</em> and I'm looking forward to the watching
                <em>The Mirror</em> (1974) to be able to hear more of on film.

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                Having already seen <em>Solaris</em> I was already eager to see
                more Tarkovsky, and I'm surprised it was taken this long. Regardless,
                I am glad that I did see these three, each brilliant in their own
                right but work together well if you are trying to get a sense of
                Tarkovsky's work.
