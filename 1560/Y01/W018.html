            <h2><em>Badlands</em> (1973)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W018-badlands.png" >
            <p>
                Based loosely on 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Starkweather">real events</a>
                <em>Badlands</em>' only real sin is a certain amount of 
                predictability (having already seen two Malick films); but maybe
                this is the wrong attitude to have with this being Malick's 
                first. You'll be getting all the cool sights and sounds 
                and nature that seem to be Malick's staples, but the writing
                in <em>Badlands</em> feels quite a bit sharper than in 
                <em>Days of Heaven</em> (1978) or <em>A Hidden Life</em> (2019),
                but conversely I think the latter two have better photography.
                Spacek (in what seems to become a pattern) has great chemistry 
                with Sheen and are both very strong in their portrayals of some 
                interesting characters. Her 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/Nh-bc4b2LDE">v/o work</a>
                is especially fun much in the same way of Manz's in <em>Days of 
                Heaven</em>.
            </p>

            
            <h2><em>3 Women</em> (1977)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W018-women.png" >
            <p>
                I don't think it has quite fully sank in for me how great
                <em>3 Women</em> is. It's greatest achievement, in my mind, is
                how weird it gets while remaining fully in the material realm.
                It doesn't force you to buy into any alternate dimension woo space
                magic, and yet it is still totally bizarre. The music, I hazard,
                is doing a lot of the legwork in this regard as the cast's 
                performances are quite reserved (this works to the film's 
                benefit). Spacek and Duvall are brilliant together and what we 
                see of Rule is great too. The film provides interesting 
                observations on personality and dreams in a package that is 
                equal parts saccharine and uneasy.

            <h2><em>Coal Miner's Daughter</em> (1980)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W018-daughter.png" >
            <p>
                <em>Coal Miner's Daughter</em> tells the story of country 
                singer Loretta Lynn's rise to fame. Spacek and Jones have 
                generally good on-screen chemistry and Spacek does a 
                particularly good job of covering Lynn's songs. A gimmick I
                always apreciate is an actor having to learn a 
                particularly distinct skill for a role: examples being <em>The
                Matrix</em> cast learning martial arts or Ralph Feinnes learning
                ballet and Russian for <em>The White Crow</em> (2018). Spacek
                is more than competent in this regard and the film's 
                <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG_qlni-PzDPWzlrgUbBMmPo5zXg42kvN">soundtrack</a>  
                is definitely worth checking out.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I can't make heads or tails of is the inclusion of a quite
                blatant marital rape scene. Is it part of a
                commitment to an honest portrayal of events? Is it 1980s 
                shorthand for 'a troubled relationship that is still ultimately
                held together by a genuine love'? One shouldn't forget that
                marital rape was not made illegal in all the United States until 
                1993. I have nothing really conclusive to say about this but it
                stuck in my mind enough to be worth mentioning.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                Spacek is as good in each of these as she is in <em>Carrie</em>
                (1976) and as I haven't seen any of her other films I have no 
                idea whether these are even her best but they are a good 
                amount of fun regardless.
