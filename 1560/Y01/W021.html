                Interesting to see Hara as the Mother figure in this one as 
                opposed to what she played in previous Ozu films. This is 
                handled well and serves as a different iteration on shared 
                themes and concepts covered in Ozu's films.

            <h2><em>The End of Summer</em> (1961)</h2>

                Nakamura is great to watch as the old owner of a sake brewing
                company juggling life between his two families.

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                I think this is it, for now. No more Ozu films for a while.
                I've enjoyed them all quite a bit but it has got to the point
                now where they are becoming a bit hard to distiguish and that
                some of them have started to merge into one sort of collage of
                match-making, weddings, sake drinking, reflecting on the war,
                dinner table discussions and lonely parents. It may have been
                a mistake to watch so many of them back-to-back, but I was
                uniquely charmed by the warmth and style of these films which
                was hard to forget when trying to choose the films for each
                successive 'next week'. It might be worth mentioning that this 
                consistency of style and content could also be in-part due to
                not just Ozu but the returning crew with Yuharu Atsuta's 
                cinematography and Kogo Noda's co-writing as well as several
                returning cast members.
            </p>
            <p> 
                There are still many Ozu films I haven't
                seen (especially some of his earlier work) so I anticipate
                eventually returning to his work. What this three week 
                experiment has given me, though, is an opportunity to think
                about what stands out as more memorable than others. In this
                regard it is easy to see why <em>Tokyo Story</em> and <em>Late
                Spring</em> are so widely celebrated as they really do stick in 
                the mind,
                but I would also throw into the mix <em>Good Morning</em> as
                one that is perhaps a bit undersung.
