            <h1>W030: Ingrid Bergman</h1>
            <p>Week starting: 2021-04-12</p>


            <h2><em>Spellbound</em> (1945)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W030-spellbound.png" >
            <p>
                Maybe a more obscure Hitchcock (not that there are any really
                obscure Hitchcock films) that I likely would have not otherwise have
                seen without this week's theme (I'm saving <em>Notorious</em> - the other film Bergman did with
                Hitchcock - for another trilogy of Hitchcock's spies.)
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Stromboli</em> (1950)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W030-stromboli.png" >
            <p>
                Traditional and modern cultures clash in this film set in
                post-war Italy (... so what does the volcano represent?)
                The tuna fishing scene stands out as particularly gruesome yet
                nonetheless very memorable.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Autumn Sonata</em> (1979)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W030-sonata.png" >
            <p>
                Bergman directs Bergman! This week's stand out film. It's 
                brilliant. Ullman and Ingrid Bergman play off each other 
                wonderfully and they make it really easy to buy into their characters.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                This week's conceit was nothing more tenuous than the fact that
                Ingrid Bergman shares a last name with
                <a href="W029.html">Ingmar Bergman</a> despite not being
                related. This minor connection allowed me to jump into the work
                of  Bergman (Ingrid) - who I had heard a lot about but never seen
                on screen - in some films I knew nothing about. This finding
                small connections between films I have seen with other I
                have not and even smaller connections sometimes between three
                films which form a theatic trilogy of films I haven't seen
                has been the most pleasurable part of the project. This has let 
                me go in 'blind' to many films I likely would have never seen
                or al least would have not seen without beforehand learning 
                a lot about. Seeing a film without knowing anything about it
                is in my view the best way to watch any film - and these three
                opitimse the pleasure gained in trying to do this. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Bergman is a great talent, giving three great performances 
                in three languages too! Who else can say that?!
