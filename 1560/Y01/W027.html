            <h2><em>The Bride Wore Red</em> (1937)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W027-red.png" >
            <p>
                Joan Crawford is great as Anni as she navigates the high society
                world she has been thrown into. I like the dialogue style a lot
                and it does the heavy lifting in transporting you to '30s Trieste
                or The Alps.  The direction is strong too and does a good job of
                moving the story at a nice pace while also considering such
                topics as class and economic mobility and the evasiveness of 
                desire.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Dance Girl Dance</em> (1940)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W027-dance.png" >
            <p>
                Lucille Ball and Maureen O'Hara are great and really are the 
                driving force of the film. It's at times very funny but in a way
                that doesn't feel too outdated. I'm sure plenty 
                could be read into it about its relevence today in evaluating
                how seriously women are taken in entertainment and art; but 
                the enjoyment of the film doesn't require necessarily keeping
                this in mind. It very much stands for itself and makes for fun
                viewing.

            <h2><em>First Comes Courage</em> (1943)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W027-courage.png" >
            <p>
                Merle Oberon is great in this WW2 Norwegian resistance story.
                It's well put together and high octane for the time. The final
                act is some first rate edge-of-your-seat stuff and really brings
                to a head what is established earlier on.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                The diversity of stories presented this week show off the skills
                of an effective director, in that while each of them are very 
                different in narrative and theme they are each still eminently
                watchable and hold up well. These are Arzner's final three
                directorial credits but I would be interested in watching some of
                her other work should I be able to find them.
