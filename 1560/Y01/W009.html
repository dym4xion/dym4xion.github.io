            <h2><em>La Pointe Courte</em> (1955)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W009-courte.png" >
            <p>
                While a lot of <em>La Pointe Courte</em>'s realism comes from the way it's shot,
                what shouldn't go unmentioned is how good its writing is too.
                Featuring such zingers as "I came here to leave you but there 
                are better things to do", "they talked too much to be happy"
                and "the bonds betweens us are stronger than we are"; it's this
                layering of small details (an infestation of cats, obscure 
                local sports, fishing techniques) that encourages you to accept 
                what the film tries to give you.

            <h2><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg89wY1Vk7E">Cléo from 5 to 7</a></em> (1962)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W009-cleo.png" >
            <p>
                Probably my favourite of the three, <em>Cléo from 5 to 7</em>
                is a sharp, intimate and quick-witted look at the narcissism that
                comes with moderate fame. But that's not all. We also get an
                insight on medical anxiety, superstition and the subjectivity of
                percieved time and a lot of cool imagery and camera work all within a 
                consise runtime. So much cool imagery, in-fact, that it was hard
                to chose a single frame for the banner image. 
            </p>

            <h2><em>Le Bonheur</em> (1965)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W009-bonheur.png" >
            <p>
                Maybe <em>Le Bonheur</em>'s strongest point is its ambiguity.
                It looks very good, but I know that it is using how it looks 
                to try to be deceptive. This is proabably one of the harder 
                films to put into words exactly why I enjoyed watching it, but
                its subtle and non-judgemental commentary that walks the line
                between cynicism and passion in a saturated Hyper-realist framing
                makes for really interesting viewing. It will have you asking yourself silly
                questions like "what does happiness look like?" and "can we be honest
                with each other? or even ourselves?"
            </p>

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                Varda's skills as a documentarian are present even in these
                narative films. In <em>La Pointe Courte</em> we are not only
                witnessing the struggles of a couple's marriage but we also
                get to see, in documentary fashion, the lives of a fishing
                community and their own struggles. Despite <em>Cléo from 5 to 7</em> being a fictional
                story, it is one told not unlike a documentary, where we have 
                a central figure exposed to some amount of fame, and we see how 
                that affects them and those around them. In a certain way it
                remined me of Sophie Fiennes' <em>Grace Jones: Bloodlight and Bami</em> (2017);
                how appropriate then Fiennes also made a doc-short on Lars von Trier
                titled: <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxlDm1eWssU">Lars from 1-10</a></em> (2001).

                Colour is important in these films. <em>La Pointe Courte</em> is filmed 
                in black and white (I don't know if this is out of necessity or not - but is works thematically) 
                and reflects certains contrasts of the film's subjects. <em>Cléo from 5 to 7</em>
                is almost entirely in black and white except for early shots of a tarot
                reading (as if anticipating more accessible colour photography technology).
                <em>Le Bonheur</em> is shot entirely in colour, generally using a extremely vibrant palette, and
                occasionally transitions using fades to blue, red, green, purple, yellow, and black only once we 
                have reached the end. It's this storytelling through colour (combined 
                with interesting staging and editing techniques and a good sense of humour) 
                that really highlights what I like about Varda and what makes her films so
                interesting to watch. See <a href="https://vimeo.com/146496085">this documentary short</a>
                for a small taste of that.
