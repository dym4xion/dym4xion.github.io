            <h2><em>Rashomon</em> (1950)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W003-rashomon.png" >
            <p>
                I like how much this film achieves with what can feel like
                so little. It has a small cast, but one you get to know over
                the course of the film, and a small plot that deepens as it
                goes on. It also makes good use of music to highlight things 
                happening on screen in a way that resembles a lot of silent era
                films. There's a lot to think about here and get out of this 
                film if you're willing to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYWQa0GExt8">go along with it</a>.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Seven Samurai</em> (1954)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W003-samurai.png" >
            <p>
                <em>Seven Samurai</em> epitomises what I like best epic period
                films. It does a really great job of providing an interesting 
                insight (regardless of how inaccurate or over romantisised) into
                the way people used to live their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                Takes its time (it has a long runtime) but it is still 
                enjoyable throughout. It is fun to watch the recruitment of 
                each of the samurai and the events which transpire to establish
                the group.
            </p>

            <h2><em>Yojimbo</em> (1961)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W003-yojimbo.png" >
            <p>
                Is it necessarily better than <a href="W002.html"><em>A Fistful of Dollars</em></a>? Probably.
                What is fascinating is that not only was the overarching plot 
                stolen, but also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeoPFQq4_UU">several smaller details</a> were taken
                as well (coffin maker, reunited family, plot-significant arson).
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe such plagarism is a testament to certain universal 
                qualities in storytelling, or at least filmmaking. It's amazing
                how well the same story can work in two totally different
                parts of the world and periods of history.
            </p>

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2> 
            <p>
                Something that is immediately apparent in these films is 
                the influence they have had on other films. Aside from the obvious
                impact <em>Yojimbo</em> and <em>Seven Samurai</em> have had on Westerns and
                other action thrillers, <em>Rashomon</em> is also a good 
                early example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreliable_narrator#Film">'unreliable narrator'</a> on the screen, and
                it's success, I think, must have something to do with
                how on-the-the-pulse this film is regarding a confusing
                component of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_effect">human experience</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you enjoy explorations on moral ambiguity as much as I do
                then you will likely enjoy these films as much as I did.
            </p>
            <p>
                As with Costa-Gavras and Sergio Leone (and many other directors
                 still), Kurosawa employs the <a href="https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/directing_is_ninety_percent_casting">"90% casting"</a> rule by re-recruiting Toshiro
                  Mifune, Takashi Shimura and Daisuke Kat√¥ as characters in these films.
                However, Mifune gives particularly fun performaces to watch 
                which range from totally maniacal in <em>Rashomon</em> to 
                totally cool in <em>Yojimbo</em> and somewhere in between
                in <em>Seven Samurai</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not much to say this week. The films stand for themselves and are each worth watching.
