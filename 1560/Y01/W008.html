            <h1>W008: Eisenstein</h1>
            <p>Week starting: 2020-11-09</p>


            <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpVtoUFKZ7w"><em>Alexander Nevsky</em> (1938)</h2></a>
            <img src="imgs/W008-nevsky.png" >
            <p>
                <em>Alexander Nevsky</em> is too modest to be
                considered a true 'epic' film. It is, however, a really 
                great piece of historical filmmaking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Featuring some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGqVogrLEE4">nice music</a> 
                from Sergei Prokofiev; it's interesting to witness here the 
                kind of film scoring that would later become so influential.
                This music does a lot of leg work in terms of the emotional 
                impact of the film, but more often that not the the music and 
                the photography work hand-in-hand to achieve something completely
                sublime. The early scenes at Pskov are some of my favourites for
                how brutal and horrific they are.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another highlight is the excellent contume design work, with costumes
                so bold that they practically tell the story on their own.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The 'Battle of the Ice' is, like Prokofiev's score, as iconic as it
                is influential. We see the components in these scenes which would go 
                on to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wY0uEoquUI">influence</a>
                future filmmakers.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Ivan the Terrible, Part 1</em> (1944)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W008-ivan1.png" >
            <p>
                In the early scenes we're given and insight into the strange religious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGBtMcSOVQY">procedures and rituals</a> 
                involved in a coronation of a Tsar. Which makes me ask: why would 
                the soviet censors allow such a glorification of a monarchic government?
                I'm sure the answer has something to do with the commonalities of how
                power functions in both forms leadership: "A state without reins is as 
                uncontrollable as a horse without a bridle." This depiction of power is 
                furthered in <em>Part 2</em> as Ivan becomes more isolated, paranoid and resigned.
            </p>

            <h2><em>Ivan the Terrible, Part 2</em> (1945)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W008-ivan2.png" >
            <p>
                Part 2 sees the continuation of Ivan's struggle against the Boyars
                and it's just as fun to watch. The highlight being the Moiseyev-esque
                'Dance of the Oprichniki' - a supurb synthesis of cinema, music, and
                choreography.
            </p>

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                Moskvin and Tisse's cinematogtaphy is consistently beautiful through each
                film.
                Nikolay Cherkasov's performances only get stronger throughout each
                film (whether as Ivan or Alexander), the peak then being in 
                <em>Ivan 2</em>, which makes it even more a loss that <em>Ivan the Terrible, Part 3</em>
                was never finished and released.
                What remains though is interesting to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KQhjPt5XUM">watch</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've thoughroughly enjoyed my time with these Eisenstein films. I was tempted this
                week to watch <em>October</em> instead of <em>Alexander Nevsky</em> as I am still
                yet to see it despite having already seeing <em>Battleship Potemkin</em>
                and <em>Strike</em>; but I think the three presented here provide a more consistent
                thematic trilogy. I anticipate I'll watch <em>October</em> soon enough when I decide
                on two other films to pair it with.
