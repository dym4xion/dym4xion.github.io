            <p>
                Not much time lately. They are each very interesting. <em>Summer
                with Monika</em> deals with new romance and the trouble with
                getting what you want. <em>Wild Strawberries</em> is an
                interesting take on the Ivan Ilyich problem - how do you live 
                a good life? and how do you consider life when you are
                nearing its end? <em>Persona</em> is the most visually arresting
                but all three are beautifully photographed. I feel the need to
                reference Lynch and Freud, but it would be wrong to do so as
                <em>Eraserhead</em> wouldn't come out for another 11 years (so 
                the direction of influence is obvious) and
                I don't know that much about Freud.
