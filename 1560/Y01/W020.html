            <p>
                Two firsts for the blog this week: (1) a back-to-back repition 
                of of a single
                theme; (2) a week whereby I really don't have anything of
                note to say about each film on their own. They are each good
                films in their own right and perhaps if I had only to write 
                about one of them I could give better thought-out view points.
                Something about watching these films next to each other and
                seeing the same techniques iterated over in slightly different
                ways has worked in such a way that they are very enjoyable to
                watch but that I struggle to point out anything significant 
                about any one. When I look at the notes I took while watching each 
                one I notice that they are generally quite superficial, but I think I
                can have a go at briefly giving a quick statement on why each
                stands out in at least one way.

                <em>TFOGTOR</em> sticks in my
                head mostly for one of its later scenes where the couple make 
                the namesake meal together late at night. Some really nice
                <em>Jeanne Dielman</em> level commitment to realism without any
                of the uneasiness. <em>Floating Weeds</em> is interesting to
                see in relation to the other films I've seen that look at the
                unexpected behind-the-scenes stories that happen in theater
                production (<em>The Producers</em> (1967), <em>Birdman</em>
                (2014)) but still with the stuff that makes an Ozu film great.
                <em>Good Morning</em> is my favourite for the week and maybe my 
                favourite Ozu so far for how brilliantly it balances silliness
                and sentimentality.

                The original conceit for this week was to watch three Ozu films 
                without 'Tokyo' or the name of a season in the title. By 
                coincidence, it would seem that this has had the effect of 
                offering a different perspective on Ozu. These films feel much
                less meditative or reflective than last week's three and are 
                a more energetic, though no less 'real' feeling, portrayals of
                midcentury life in Japan. It might be of note to some that
                the seccond two from this week are self-remakes of silent films
                Ozu made in the 30s - an interesting practice I had not seen 
                anywhere in film production before but would seem like 
                <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2013/11/10-directors-who-remade-their-own-movies-91369/">something</a> 
                that is not totally unconventional.

                I've enjoyed the 6 Ozu films I've seen so far but I still have
                a taste for them and right now there is nothing I want to watch
                more than...
