            <h2><em>Cairo Station</em> (1958)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W007-cairo.png" >
            <p>
                You could say that <em>Cairo Station</em> is a bit like 
                <em>City Lights</em> meets <em>Brief Encounter</em> meets 
                <em>Psycho</em>, but I think that would be doing the film
                a bit of a disservice. It's fast-paced and chaotic and you
                feel as the film will run away from you if you don't 
                keep up with it. It's also really quite amazing how many 
                things this film touches on in such a short run time. In
                only 77 minutes it looks at: copycat crime, labour unions, 
                sexuality, religion, class, poverty, insanity, fatherhood,
                musicals, marriage, obsession, women's rights; 
                and not with a lost to depth, as 
                some of these themes intersect and interrelate in a way that
                this film captures in an interesting way.

            <h2><em>Saladin</em> (1963)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W007-saladin.png" >
            <p>
                This long epic concerning the Christian crusades, told moreso 
                from the Arab perspective, revels in its strategic, political, and religious complexities.
                It is the complexity and nuance that is maybe what makes it most
                interesting as you follow the developing romance between the 
                Christian crusader, Louisa, and the Catholic Arab, Issa, repeatedly separated
                and brought together by conflict. It's geopolitics are still
                relevant today and are a sad reminder of how little can sometimes 
                change even over long periods of time. Maybe this is what makes the 
                best historical epics so good: to highlight the historicity of
                modern problems.

            <h2><em>Alexandria... Why?</em> (1979)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W007-alexandria.png" >
            <p>
                Good autobiographical filmmaking, <em>Alexandria... Why?</em> 
                continues <em>Cairo Station</em>'s social realism but this time
                looking at the experience of Alexandrians during WWII. As a 
                lot of WWII is told from the European, American or Japanese 
                perspective, it was refreshing to see it from the Egyptian 
                point-of-view. The commonalities and differences from what we 
                might be used to in more standard homefront depictions are
                interesting to observe - the use of interjected war footage
                compounds this. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps <em>Alexandria... Why</em>'s most commendable merit is,
                like its leading character, that it knows exactly what it wants.
                Everything feels purposeful in its aims to celebrate the virtues
                of ambition, creativity, resilience and love.

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2> 
            <p>
                Each of these films are immensely <b>bold</b> for their time;
                and in a lot of ways they are still bold today. I'm glad I have
                seen them and I am looking forward to watching more of Chahine's
                films, a privalige I am afforded by way of many of them 
                (including these three) being on Netflix in the U.K.
