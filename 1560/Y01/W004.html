            <h2><em>Great Expectations</em> (1946)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W004-great.png" >
            <p>
                <em>Great Expectations</em> checks all of the boxes that you
                would expect from a good Dickens adaptation. It is very funny 
                throughout and features a litany of zany characters with 
                <a href="https://londonist.com/2016/04/odd-dickens-names">silly names</a> 
                and is niether too self-serious nor does it shy away from more sentimental
                gestures. I think you can attribute these same reasons to the success
                of Armando Iannucci's <em>The History of David Copperfield</em> (2019) 
                but also that both stories share components that give them a universal
                appeal. This universal/timeless appeal (which probably comes from Dickens moreso
                than any other component of the film) is maybe best demonstrated by the fact that
                since 1917 there have been no less that 11 film adaptations of this film.

                The spooky foggy scenes in on the marshes and at the graveyard in the
                beginning of the film really stick in the mind as the most visually stiking
                parts, but it has really great photography throughout.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>The Bridge on the River Kwai</em> (1957)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W004-bridge.png" >
            <p>
                Lots of great stuff in this one but I don't have much to say about it. 
                It offers some interesting things to think about on morality in 
                war, specifically to do with prisoners of war, but I think it
                works well mostly because it is fun to watch. Great performances
                from Alec Guiness but from Sessue Hayakawa as well and 
                strong direction too. Worth seeing if only for the fact that it's 
                a major cultural touch-stone.
            </p>

            <h2><em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> (1962)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W004-arabia.png" >
            <p>
                We turn to another war epic here but <em>Lawrence</em> is much
                greater in scope. It runs at about 3 hours and 40 minutes and 
                chronicles the embedding of a British soldier among Arab tribes
                during the Arab Revolt. It's a good exercise in patient filmmaking/filmwatching
                as there is a lot of worthwhile things to take away from this film, 
                but it takes its time to deliver them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It features, again, some great photography but this time of vast desert expanses
                and also like <em>Bridge</em> some subtle but provocative commentary, still 
                relevant today. My favourite exchange:
            </p>
            <p>
                SHERIF ALI: "A man can do whatever he wants. You said."</br>
                LAWRENCE: "He can ... but he can't want what he wants."
            </p>
            <p>
                I think that these line encapsulate so much of what this film is about: 
                it says so much without really saying anything at all.
                The same is true of the very last scene which is devastating despite 
                being so understated.

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2> 
            <p>
                David Lean shares with Dickens an intense understanding of humanity and how to
                effectively translate that in art. For this reason primarily do these films work well
                together, as they each share this quality. He's a great 'storyteller director'
                in the sense that at the core of these films is a 'good' story, but Lean's interest
                with the different roles in making a film (such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EpORAz2R8U">editing</a>)
                ensure that the story is cohesively told.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was intending to see how these films compare to another Lean film
                that I have already seen: <em>Brief Encounter</em>, but they are so
                different that they are not worth comparing. <em>Brief Encounter</em> is
                great though, as is Zizek's use of it in examining 'The Big Other' in
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HPrgr166YCY">this clip</a>.
