            <h2><em>Meet Me in St. Louis</em> (1944)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W031-louis.png" >

            <p>
                Perhaps the most glorious of the glorious Technicolor films I
                have seen. But I am yet to see <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> in full
                HD. Lighthearted and fun, like all good musicals it doesn't let
                the songs get in the way of the story.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Judgement at Nuremberg</em> (1961)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W031-nuremberg.png" >

            <p>
                Several great performances from a great cast. It's about three
                hours long but it doesn't feel like it - the court sessions 
                breeze by.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Gay Purr-ee</em> (1962)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W031-purr-ee.png" >
            <p>
                Great colours, great animation. Interesting love-letter to the
                French impressionist movement.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2>
            <p>
                Garland is great in each of these. While she isn't front and 
                center in <em>Judgement at Nuremberg</em> she nonetheless gives
                a great dramatic performances. Her singing in the first and last
                of this week's films is also great and provided a fun change of
                pace.
