            <h2><a href="https://youtu.be/iJBUUoHZCZA&t=286s"><em>Sacco e Vanzetti</em> (1971)</a></h2>

            <p>
                The last thing you might expect about <em>Sacco e Vanzetti</em>
                is that it was filmed in Dublin. This must be a testament to
                transportive quality of the film. They do a really convincing
                job of placing you in the Italian anarchist/immigrant community
                of 1920s Boston. It's not as if I can attest to the accuracy of
                this portrayal but the film never really forces you to suspend
                any disbelief; you can really buy into the pre-McCarthyist
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Red_Scare">First Red Scare</a> setting.
            </p>

                It makes for enjoyable viewing largely for the same reasons 
                <a href="W001.html">Costa-Gavras'</a> and
                <a href="W017.html">Lina Wertm√ºller's</a> films do, as it
                takes obliquely political concepts and can relate them to a
                completely human perspective. Gian Maria Volonte gives the same
                stellar performace that he does in the first two <a href="W002.html">Dollars films</a>
                and his co-stars are strong too.

                Baez and Morricone collaborate well together to create some 
                great music for the film. Baez's lyrics and vocals are
                heartbreaking and Morricone's composition is, as expected, very
                moving. Thematically, it suits the film very well which is no
                surprise for an original score by 'the Maestro'. The
                stand-out final song <em>Here's to You</em> is brilliantly
                simple with the last two lines for the repeated verse coming 
                from 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here%27s_to_You_(song)">an interview with Vanzetti</a>.

            <h2><a href="https://youtu.be/l-JW4DKxwQM"><em>Joe Hill</em> (1971)</a></h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W025-hill.png" >
            <p>
                We start this section with a slight mystery. The song <em>Joe
                Hill</em> sung by Joan Baez is not featured in the film as
                far as I can tell despite being credited on her IMDb page as 
                an uncredited performer of the song and being credited in the
                VHS home release's end-credits. That the 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/o539JJoHUWs">restored version</a>
                doesn't credit Baez in the opening credits (and has no
                end-credits) brings me to two possible conclusions: (1) Baez's
                cover of the song was in the original theatrical release but 
                was cut from home format releases for whatever reason and 
                someone forgot to change the credits, or, (2)
                Baez was credited in the end-credits of the VHS release, despite
                the song not being used in the film, as an indication of a 
                significant source of inspiration. This second reason makes a
                bit more sense in the context that two years prior Baez sang it
                at Woodstock which became one of the more popular recordings. If
                you like the song the
                <a href="https://youtu.be/n8Kxq9uFDes">Paul Robeson</a> 
                and
                <a href="https://youtu.be/f_yC4ffyGiw">Pete Seegler</a>
                covers are worth checking out; as is the 
                <a href="https://youtu.be/yUR2PDTptO0"><em>The Ballad of Joe Hill</em></a>
                by Phil Ochs.

                In regards to the film itself, I was very impressed. I wanted to
                put that commonly regarded idea of cinema being a sort of 
                universal language to the test by firstly: tolerating the poor 
                video quality of the copy I had; and secondly: not searching out subtitles 
                for the film (even though I'm sure they are widely avaiable
                online) so that I had really no idea what was being said during
                the Swedish speaking parts. This experience really demonstrated 
                the truth to this cinema universalism sentiment because despite the subtractions 
                from a normal film viewing experience, I was still really 
                engaged with the film and it went along nicely. Bo Widerberg's 
                direction is competent yet adventurous and Thommy Berggren has
                all the energy of a young Pacino.

            <h2><a href="https://youtu.be/RTFFmH85y5A"><em>Silent Running</em> (1972)</a></h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W025-running.png" >
            <p>
                I feel fortunate to not have been cursed by watching this film
                as a child as I'm sure that if I did I would be as overly
                sentimental about it as
                <a href="https://youtu.be/4YoJaG-9XZE">Edgar Wright</a> or
                <a href="https://youtu.be/dUsV5LP30rU">Mark Kermode</a>,
                two people I otherwise respect.
                The film does have some great special FX and set design; all the
                practical components of the film (music included) work together
                well but it is let down by a particularly silly story. I don't
                know why this film is evoking, from me, such a negative response
                but I can't help but feel that this may perhaps be the best made 
                stupid film I have seen in a long time and could be markedly
                improved simply by removing all of the dialogue.

                Bruce Dern is properly hammy, which is a shame as we never
                really get much of an insight from the other human characters,
                so it lacks a bit of the human dimensionality that I think the film 
                wants to celebrate. As such, the three robots are the film's
                most sympathetic characters and I like to think that when Lowell
                isn't looking they talk behind his back about how crazy he is
                for <span class="spoiler">killing his crewmates before even
                trying to argue his case for saving the biodomes</span>.
            </p>

            <p>
                There's an amazing disonance of imagination where the film can
                concieve of interplanetary freighter spaceships with self
                sustaining biodomes but not a automatic snooker table that can
                reset all of the balls at a pace faster than one ball every 10
                seconds!

                Despite raising moral questions I don't think it has any real 
                morality and calling it 'morally ambiguous' would be too much of
                a complement: it's moreso just morally inconsistent, confused
                or corrupt. When the film asks you "how far would you go to save
                the last surviving forest?" I don't think it's too cynical to
                retort with equally silly questions like "but where are the 
                bears and wolves?" or "what is nature for, when (in the fantasy 
                of the film) all of humanity's needs are satisfied?"
            </p>

            <p>
                Baez's singing is beautiful regardless, even if sparsely used.

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2> 
            <p>
                The films that most warrant comparison are obviously the first
                two. Both concern the early history of the American labour 
                movement paired in some way with the treatment of early 20th
                century immigrants. It's odd how strikingly similar they are in 
                that both end up with <span class="spoiler">the main 
                character(s) -- both of which being immigrant labour organisers
                -- facing an unjust death sentence trial</span> and, albiet more 
                superficially, that both films came out in the same year.
