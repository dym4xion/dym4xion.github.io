            <p>Week starting: 2020-10-26</p>


            <h2><em>12 Angry Men</em> (1957)</h2>
            <img src="imgs/W006-angry.png" >
            <p>
                What I like best about <em>12 Angry Men</em> is it's simplicity and
                emersive quality. By most of it taking place in 'real-time' and with
                camera angles at the sitting hight of the juror's table, it feels almost
                as if you are the 13th Angry Man, making the writing and performances
                even more compelling, as you try to determine for yourself the defendant's
                guilt.
            </p>

            <h2><em>Anatomy of a Murder</em> (1959)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W006-anatomy.png" >
            <p>
                <em>Anatomy of a Murder</em>'s main merit is its ability to blend
                a certain amount of humour and Jazz with the grim nature 
                of the court case. It's fun to watch Jimmy Steward's Paul Biegler
                bend the rules of engagement in the courtroom in order to help
                his client beat the case, even when he is charged with the murder
                of his wife's rapist.
            </p>
            
            <h2><em>Kramer Vs. Kramer</em> (1979)</h2> 
            <img src="imgs/W006-kramer.png" >
            <p>
                What immediately stands out to me about <em>Kramer Vs. Kramer</em> is how
                similar it is to 2019's <em>Marriage Story</em>. I enjoyed both films quite
                a bit - I think for the same reasons, but I can't quite pin down what exactly 
                those reasons are. It's a devestating situation that is portrayed in both films
                and they both do a great job of translating those stories to film 
                in a way that is accessible to people who haven't been through 
                anything like it. Hoffman and Streep give killer, 'Academy Award Winning'
                performances and are reason enough to watch the film.

            <h2>Notes and Conclusions</h2> 
            <p>
                While these are films that do, in a major way, concern the American
                legal system, and to that end: 'The Courtroom', it is interesting
                to note how in each film the courtroom itself is really only a 
                superficial framing to allow the drama to unfold. I'm sure if I
                watched more courtroom dramas that this property holds for most 
                of them - I can't imagine a story about the courtroom in-and-of-itself 
                being that interesting - but it was something particularly
                noticable in this week's films as I questioned whether each of these
                films were even very appropriate to viewed under the theme. 
                <em>12 Angry Men</em> only spends the first few minutes in the
                courtroom, and <em>Anatomy of a Murder</em> and <em>Kramer Vs. Kramer</em>
                don't get there until after the first hour.
