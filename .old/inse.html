  <h1>Introduction to Software Engineering</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>Week 1</h2>
    <p>The first lecture in INSE largely covered the way in which the assessments
    are conducted. The unit covers topics surrounding: teamwork, programming and documentation,
    in environments that seek to develop complex software systems. This will require
    confident use of Git/GitHub as coursework contributions are evaluated by Git commits.</p>
    <p>This week featured no practical tutorial.</p>
  </section>

    <h2>Week 2</h2>
    <p>
      In the lecture this week we looked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Methodologies" target="_blank">Software Process Models</a>.
      We looked at the Waterfall, Incremental Development, and Reuse Oriented Software
      Engineering models and their advantages and disadvantages in satisfying the
      fundamental activies of:
      <ul>
        <li>Specification</li>
        <li>Design</li>
        <li>Implementation</li>
        <li>Validation</li>
        <li>Evolution</li>
      </ul>
      and how the models can accomodate documentation and configuration management.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tutorial this week we met our project groups and were given our project
      brief. Our project consists of developing a Shopping Price Comparison App.
    </p>

    <h2>Week 3</h2>
    <p>
      In this week's lecture, we looked extensively at Agile Software Development Models.
      A useful reference might be <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">the Agile Manifesto</a>,
      which lists the ways in which a development model can be 'agile'.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Agile development philosophy can be separated into separate sub-methodologies.
      These can include: Extreme Programming, Scrum, and Feature-Driven Development.
      Each provide a slightly different perspective on how agility can be achieved.
    </p>
  </section>
  <h2>Week 4</h2>
  <p>In the lecture this week, we looked at the case study of the failure of the
     London Ambulance Services systems update and the context for it in the process
     of software engineering. An important question to consider is: Where does reponsibility
     sit in largescale projects where no one if made officially accountable.</p>
  <p>In the tutorial session, we simulated the process of software development within
     a corporation located across many officies in many countries.</p>
