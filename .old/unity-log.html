      <p>
        ProGrids and Polybrush, as well as Pro Builder, are essential tools in
        3D world creation within Unity. Both are rather approachable after
        watching a few tutorial videos and offer potential in the intuative 3D
        space development.

      <h2>2018-05-25: Experimenting with Pro Builder</h2>
      <p>
        3D world design in Unity did not come intuitively. Through the use of Pro Builder I can see how skills can be developed such that design can be more intuitively implemented in Unity 3D.
