    <h1>Introduction to Programming</h1>
    <p>
      In this unit I exlored fundamental programming concepts such as data types,
      classes and code quality while utilising the Python and Java programming
      languages.

      <h2>Python Coursework</h2>
      <h3>The Task</h3>
      <p>
        For the coursework involving Python, we were tasked with programming a
        'Patchwork Sampler' using the
        <a href="http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py" target="_blank">John Zelle graphics package</a>
        as defined by the
        <a href="media/pycoursework.pdf" target="_blank">given specification</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary requirements for the Patchwork Sampler were to:
        <ul>
          <li>Accept user input for grid sizes 5x5, 7x7, 9x9 and 11x11.</li>
          <li>Accept user input for three unique colours from a range of eight.</li>
          <li>Draw the patches in the given pattern.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional features that we were encouraged to implement include:
        <ul>
          <li>User interaction to swap the position of two tiles by clicking
          each of them.</li>
          <li>User interation to swap the pattern of any tile but keep the colour
          by double clicking a single tile.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Execution</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="media/patchwork.py">Here</a> is the code that forms the Patchwork
        Sampler. It is dependant on the graphics.py file linked above.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program runs as expected and takes user input from the shell for the
        size of the grid and the three chosen colours.
      </p>

      <h3>Improvements</h3>
      <p>
        One fatal error that can occur during runtime is: if a non-integer value
        is input when the grid size is requested. This is because the code I wrote
        attempts to convert the input string into and integer before checking
        whether the input string is valid. This could be rectified with a simple
        if else statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        A minor issue with the way I drew the patchwork design is that the initial
        circle patches in the bottom right-hand-side of the window should be consistanly
        3x3 regardless of patchwork size, however I misread the brief assumed the
        circle section would grow with the window.

      <h2>Java Coursework</h2>
      <h3>The Task</h3>
      <p>
        For our Java based coursework, we were tasked with writing classes that could
        emulate a pizza ordering system. We were given template and starter classes
        which we needed to build off from to develop a functioning program. Code
        quality and design were also assessed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The brief for the coursework can be found <a href="media/javacoursework.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The primary objectives were to:
        <ul>
          <li>Take user input which considers the size, crust type, sauce and toppings of the pizza.</li>
          <li>Enter information for upto six pizzas.</li>
          <li>Display the pizzas within a window using the Canvas package.</li>
          <li>Consider the total cost of the order.</li>
          <li>Make use of Javdoc commenting.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We were also encouraged to:
        <ul>
          <li>Enable the user to modify or remove any pizza.</li>
          <li>Enable the user to enter more than six pizzas, but maintaining the number of pizzas per window to six.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Execution</h3>
      <p>
        The program generally runs well and input validation is implemnted where
        needed.

        <figcaption>Pizza ordering system with six displayed pizzas</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Improvements</h3>
      <p>
        One way in which my program could be improved would be to accomodate for
        users who desire no toppings. This was not an option I considered until
        the program was assessed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another instance in which the program could have been improved is to limit
        the number of windows displaying pizzas to one, regardless of the number
        of pizzas input. The user would then change between a series of 'screens'
        which would each display upto six pizzas.
