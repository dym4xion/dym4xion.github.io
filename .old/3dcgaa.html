      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <p>
        In the first week's lecture we looked at some of the topics we are covering
        throughout the unit, as well as some of the applications of 3D computer
        graphics and animation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the practical tutorial, we were introduced to the basics of modelling in 3D Studio
        Max, including the 3DSM UI and working with primatives.

      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <p>
        In the second week's lecture we covered content that looked at the graphics
        pipeline and coordinate systems. We also looked at Graphics APIs, which include:
        the Standard API, OpenGL, WebGL, and Direct 3D.
      </p>
      <p>
        We learned that in 3D modelling, to generate an image we need:
        <ul>
          <li>Object models.</li>
          <li>A view platform: position and orientation.</li>
          <li>Projection: Light rays, tracing paths.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        We also looked at projections, both: orthographic and perspective, as well
        as persective distortions and the roles of the viewing window/frustrum.
      </p>
      <p>
        An important take-away from this lecture included the prodedure of the
        graphics pipeline. One way to describe the graphics pipeline is the process
        of: Local coordinate systems --&gt; World coordinate systems --&gt; Camera
        coordinate systems --&gt; 3D screen space --&gt; Orthographic projection.
      </p>
      <p>
        The coordinate systems are used to provide the imformation enable operations
        to be performed on models. It applies a map to the 3D world to define positions
        and orientations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the practical session we looked at Compound Objects and experimented
        with them in 3Ds Max.

      <h2>Week 3</h2>
      <p>
        In this week's lecture we looked at modeling using geometric priamtives
        and volume based modelling. We explored both 'hierarchical modelling' and
        'constructive solid geometry' (CSG) methods of using primatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hierarchical modelling method works by combining several primatives
        through transformations into one linked object, whereas the CSG method works
        by using boolean operations on primatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        When looking at volume based modelling, we explored the Octree method which
        works by evaluating: world space, tessellation and labelling.

      <p>
        In our tutorial session we explored Loft Objects in 3D Studio Max. As a
        result we produced models of curtains and an object with twists.

      <h2>Week 4</h2>
      <p>In the lecture this week, we looked at Modelling with Polygon Meshes. This
      included looking at: vector and surface normals, defining a polygon mesh, issues
      with resolutions and the aquisition of polygon mesh models.</p>
      <p>A polygon mesh is a connected collection of polygonal <em>facets</em> along
      with directional information. </p>
      <p>In the practical session we looked at Modelling with Meshes in 3DSM to create
         various 3D shapes. The primary focus was to model an apple, but with the spare
         time I had, I had fun with bitmaps in the material editor and modelled a
         Sierpinski Pyramid with my newfound knowledge of snapping to vertices.</p>
