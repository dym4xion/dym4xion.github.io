    <li>Happy New Year!!!</li>
    <li>This entry is going to cover an attempt at designing a logo for the site.</li>
    <li>Decided that I would use the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=castellar+font&rlz=1C1GCEA_enGB783&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjU-c7yjZ7ZAhUFWBQKHaGNAOsQ_AUICigB&biw=944&bih=922">Castellar</a> as the font for my logo.</li>
    <li>I forgot to keep track of the design at different stages so here is the final design I went with and a bunch of other Inkscape drawings.</li>
  </ul>

  <figure class="portfolio-figs">
    <img class="portfolio-fig-img" src="media/font-selection.PNG" alt="Inkscape screengrab of a selection of fonts." />
    <figcaption>My selection of 16 fonts from the fonts available in Inkscape</figcaption>

    <figcaption>I don't know what this is.</figcaption>

  <p class="long-underline">12/02/18</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The use of Java packages was practiced through drawing images with the Canvas package.</li>
    <li>Included in this entry is my attempt at drawing a boat scene.</li>
    <li>So far I have found the Canvas package to be harder to use than the John Zelle Python module but this is largely due to having less experience with Java. With practice, graphics in Java should become easier.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Video editing skills were practiced as I prepared a video guide for my site.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="long-underline">16/02/18 - Site first submission day</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For the past two days I have been making small adjustments to my site's CSS and HTML. For the most part I am happy with it but it could do with some major improvements before the final submission.</li>
    <li>Planned improvements:
        <ul>
          <li>Use of ARIA tags. ✔</li>
          <li>A collapsible navigation. ✔ (An alternative solution was used.)</li>
          <li>Better mobile usability (this should come with using collapsible navigation).</li>
          <li>Multiple video formats. ✔</li>
          <li>Create a 'HTML Valid' button like the valid CSS button. ✔</li>
          <li>Add month based navigation for the P/L-J and document navidation for the literature review. ✔</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
