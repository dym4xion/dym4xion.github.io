You are now watching my website video guide.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This is my home page. It provides the overview for my site.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
By clicking on the 'Validate my HTML!' link at the bottom of each page,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
you can validate each of my webpages with the W3 validator.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The same can be done with the 'Valid CSS' button on each page.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
By clicking on the navigation links on the left, different parts of the site can be accessed.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Here is my discovery log. It contains details on the things I have learned throughout studying the WEBF1 unit.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It also contains links to other relevant pages.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:18.000
On the right hand side is the discovery log page navigation. This allows you to traverse the discovery log with ease.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This is my Portfolio / Learning Journal. It acts as an informal account of the things I have learnt and done on my course.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This is my literature review page. It contains both the submitted artifact as well as the marking comments I received.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.000
