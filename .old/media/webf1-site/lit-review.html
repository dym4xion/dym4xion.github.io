    <h1>Mitigating corporate information exposure on the web.</h1>
    </header>
    <section>
      <h2 id="intro"><span class="lit-shift">Introduction</span></h2>
      <p>It can be observed that the web is becoming the default vector for the distribution of data within a corporate environment. Therefore the mitigation of the public exposure of sensitive corporate data on the web is often of paramount concern for
        many organisations.

        <h2 id="tech-pol"><span class="lit-shift">Technical Policies</span></h2>
        <p>A functioning system for the protection of data and mitigation of information exposure is often dependant on well designed technical policies. One policy that Morrow suggests is to consider how organisations can control the replication of data
          while using a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy. Through the use of a BYOD policy, organisations can expose themselves to several attack vectors through compromised devices and applications. This especially regards personal devices that have
          had data logging programs maliciously installed on devices that access sensitive corporate data (Morrow 2012).</p>
        <p>Gordon reinforces the importance of organisations being aware of the ways in which employees can inadvertently leak data when they discuss the need for a control system over the movement of files containing corporate data. Gordon comments on the
          fact that malware signature detection is not completely effective due to the ability to make changes to malware to alter its signature, making detection difficult (Gordon, 2007, p.37). This analysis of the limitations of the different methods
          to mitigate information exposure demonstrates an understanding that no single method of attempting to secure data is infallible. Such an attitude is reflected throughout the information security industry to the extent that Gordon’s recommendations
          may be evaluated as credible.</p>

        <h2 id="non-tech-pol"><span class="lit-shift">Non-technical Policies</span></h2>
        <p>Despite the importance of having effective technical policies, ensuring corporations have a clear understanding of the non-technical policies that can be implemented to protect data is essential. Mitnick discusses the efficacy of social engineering
          (SE) in exposing corporate information through manipulating employees of a targeted company (Mitnick, 2002, p. 247). Gordon reinforces the remarks made by Mitnick through Gordon’s considerations on SE where it is discussed that while SE attacks,
          specifically phishing emails, “rely on ignorance”, they are often effective in acquiring private data (Gordon, 2007, p.25).</p>
        <p>Additionally, Mitnick suggests data security should be a concern for all employees within a corporation and that nurturing an attitude of enthusiasm regarding an employee's responsibility to secure corporate information prevents employees maliciously
          exposing data. It can be observed that this suggestion has credibility through Morrow’s remarks on how organisations should educate end users on the importance of security, due to data leaks often being caused by insider carelessness (Morrow,
          2012). Both Mitnick’s and Morrow’s sentiments are further emphasised by Williams et al. as they discuss the significance of the role of the individual within the process of securing data, due to the variability in which employees “engage in
          systematic evaluation when viewing online communications” (Williams et al., 2017).</p>
        <p>Despite both Mitnick and Gordon recognising the significance of non-technical policies, Mitnick emphasises the factor of SE to a far greater extent while Gordon focuses on specific implementations of where technical methods can develop the benefits
          of having an effective non-technical policy. Using both author’s recommendations can generate a comprehensive understanding of the necessary non-technical precautions an organisation may take to mitigate information exposure.</p>

        <h2 id="inc-res"><span class="lit-shift">Incident Response</span></h2>
        <p>While an understanding of both technical and non-technical methods for preventing information exposure can be critical, a corporation’s response can be the controlling factor in preventing sensitive data exposure in the eventuality of a cyber
          attack. Anderson suggests that through the use of checklisting and team resource management (TRM) an efficient mechanism can be set up for responding to incidents. Through utilising TRM a flexible approach can be used to optimise human performance
          through cultivating team-based tools and practices to reduce the response time against attacks compared to traditional command and control approaches (Anderson, 2017). Anderson’s analysis of the advantages of a checklist/TRM system over a traditional
          command and control approach demonstrates an understanding of the subject which can give credibility to their work.</p>
        <p>Anderson’s proposals can be ratified by Hawkins as they comment on the importance of an effective platform for critical communication during an attack, however Hawkins specifically discusses the requirement for multi-modality with a corporation's
          communication mediums to ensure more effective communication (Hawkins, 2017). This simultaneity of ideas can suggest validity within both Hawkins’ and Anderson’s reflections. However neither Hawkins or Anderson provide discussion on autonomous
          response systems which is presented by Cazorla et al. as an effective method in providing an effective response to critical system attacks (Cazorla et al., 2015).</p>
        <p>Moreover, the NCSC looks at the tasks that can be completed after incidents to gain an understanding of system vulnerabilities. These tasks can reduce the likelihood of further incidents occurring and thus reduce further information exposure.
          While both Anderson and the NCSC discuss principle ideas on incident response, it could be argued that a more effective document could unify the abstract policies for incident management presented by Anderson as well as recommending detailed
          tasks an organisation would benefit from completing after an incident of an attack.</p>

        <h2 id="conc"><span class="lit-shift">Conclusion</span></h2>
        <p>Mitnick states how the most effective method of preventing SE attacks is through combined use of security technologies and non-technical policy to ensure employee behavior does not compromise an organisation’s data (Mitnick, 2002, p. 245). This
          attitude can extrapolate to be equally relevant in instilling a philosophy regarding an effective method of preventing data exposure. Utilising combined techniques within this philosophy can enable a corporation to mitigate any future information
          exposure on the web.</p>

      <p>
        This attained a grade of 85%.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Good review throughout. Topic has been reviewed well with well balanced understanding. Justifiable mixture of primary and secondary sources. Excellent citation style, structure, spelling and grammar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The literature review is excellently written and supported by a variety of creditable sources. Authors' works' relationships have been demonstrated multiple times and there is a clear structure. There was only one error that I noticed while reading,
	in the sentence "Despite both Mitnick and Gordon recognising the significance non-technical policies, Mitnick emphasises...", it looks like you're missing the word "of" between "significance" and "non-technical" <strong>[This has been ammended in the current
	online document]</strong>. Otherwise, there are no other errors to note.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a good literature review that correctly understands the topics well. Sources are cited well and spelling is consistently good throughout."
