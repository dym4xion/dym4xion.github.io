  <h2 id='week1'><span class="long-underline">Week 1</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Learned how to make use of the VM. Take note that the number of entered password characters cannot be seen.</li>
    <li>Thought about the process for of planning for deadlines (i.e. breaking up larger tasks into smaller ones and how that may apply to our course work.)</li>
    <li>Coursework specification available <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/myport.ac.uk/document/d/1G4E68wHibkX6m6PSx6ZCJoWUjg2APqFGSpflezgT_iI/edit?usp=sharing">here.</a></li>
    <li>Evaluated and justified what we thought were the most and least useful websites as well as produce an idea for a website that could be created "if money and status were no object" to provide a currently non-existant service. Submitted responses:</li>
  </ul>
    <div id="sites-review">
      <h4>Most useful site: google.com</h4>
      <p>Provides a centralised engine to quickly access the majority of services that I most frequently use. Advanced search option allows for a refined search for more specific sites. Majority of searches are satisfied within the first two pages of results.
        Additionally, creating an account with Google provides instant access to a litany of other google services as well as gaining the ability to sign into third party websites with google login details, making for a more streamlined experience and
        centralised account security, limiting the distribution of sensitive information.</p>
      <h4>Most flawed site: facebook.com</h4>
      <p>Promoting an attitude of being liberal with the quantity and type of information people should make public could lead to an increase in personal data vulnerability. Creates a pathway for social engineers posing as mutual friends to gain access to
        personal information. Unnecessarily intrusive data collection when generating adverts. Provides an effective method for communicating with coworkers, friends and relatives due to large user base but could be done in a manner that minimises the
        publicity of personal details (liked pages, friends/family lists).</p>
      <h4>Website Idea:</h4>
      <p>A project/idea development service whereby users could publicly submit ideas and projects they want to complete to gain the attention of potential collaborators. Projects can be of any scale and can be based around any technical specialty or skill
        set. Users can host a portfolio on a personal page for project initiators to evaluate whether other users who request to collaborate on a project would be appropriate. Project initiator would describe the project they are undertaking and list
        the required skills of individuals they are looking to collaborate with. Project development environment could be hosted in browser with collaborators having access to a file repository, text and voice communication.</p>
      <p>While there are online project development services and file repositories, many are directed to software development. This site could aggregate projects based around anything from creative writing to mechanical engineering, to enable users to take
        part in and develop ideas in their field.</p>
    </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Through looking at the available text editors, it has been decided that I will be learning through using the atom text editor.</li>
    <li>Reading through the first chapter of Information Security and Management Principles, <a href="infosec-notes.html">notes</a> were made on what was considered to be important.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2 id='week2'><span class="long-underline">Week 2</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Practical session work led to disscussion on, and discovery of, ideas surrounding the ways in which we generate data.</li>
    <li>Below is my group's assessment of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data we generate.</li>

        <td>Middling to high level of confidentiality. Not the most sensitive information but could be exploited.</td>
        <td>Depends case by case. Importance of integrity is different for the types of data being tracked.</td>
        <td>Should only be available to sites with permission.</td>

      <tr>
        <td><b>GPS Data</b></td>
        <td>Same principle as with availability.</td>
        <td>Should be as as correct as possible. Would be frustrating for map data to be inaccurate.</td>
        <td>Preferably only access by user but needs to be accessed by provided service to provide GPS.</td>

        <td><b>University NFC Card Reading</b></td>
        <td>Not very confidential, used as proof of attendance. Get most use out of by not being confidential.</td>

    <ul>
    <li>Further discoveries were made in the realm of navigating the Linux command line to the extent of being able to make and edit text files. See <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2598082/linux/linux-linux-command-line-cheat-sheet.html"> here</a> for a reminder.</li>
    <li>Here are some useful example commands:</li>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li>cat [filename] - open text files.</li>
        <li>vi [filename] - open text file in the vim text editor.</li>
        <li>In the vim text editor: 'i' will insert text into the file; esc will let you stop inserting text; and ':wq↵' will save the file and exit the text editor.</li>
        <li>cd - changes the directory.</li>
        <li>cd .. - will change the current directory up a level.</li>
        <li>mkdir - will make a new directory.</li>
        <li>cat > [filename] - will make a new file.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>It's important to think about the the abstract level at which we can think about corporate security due to the amount AND methods of which data is created and tracked.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2 id='week3'><span class="long-underline">Week 3</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Discoveries made through week 3 had a focus on the quality of methods in which we use to research topics.</li>
    <li>The <a href="https://library.port.ac.uk">online library resource</a> is a very efficient method finding papers and other high quality information.</li>
  </ul>



  <h2 id='week4'><span class="long-underline">Week 4</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Through woriking on my literature review, it has been found that: finding enough material to write about is not quite as hard as finding too much material to write about and needing to systematically remove work in order of less priority.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2 id='week5'><span class="long-underline">Week 5</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This week discoveries we specifically made in regard to developing an understanding of effective academic writing methods. Such methods can include:
      <ul>
        <li>Replacing phrasal verbs (i.e. They have been <b>looking into</b> the issue for decades. → They have been <b>investigating</b> the issue for decades.).</li>
        <li>Choosing appropriate adjectives.</li>
        <li>Choosing formal words and phrases</li>
        <li>Eliminating contractions.</li>
        <li>Avoiding personal and subjective writing.</li>
        <li>Exercising caution</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>To practice, we applied the skills we learned to a peice of previously written text. See the improved text below:</li>
  </ul>

    <div id="ruby-parag">
      <p><b>The Impact of the Ruby Programming Language on Modern Computing:</b></p>
      <p>Perhaps Ruby’s most significant impact on modern computing is through its implementation on the Ruby on Rails web framework, which gained the programming language popularity with programmers outside of Japan due to Rails’ “Convention over Configuration”
        philosophy which allowed development of a web-service to be intuitive as well as many users finding site maintenance easier (Marx, 2014). This philosophy led to Ruby on Rails to be an effective web framework against other web frameworks, with
        sites such as: Hulu, Yellow Pages and GitHub being developed on Rails (Wojciechowicz, 2015). Rails has been able to maintain its popularity due to users finding Roby code to be highly readable and having a focus on being a completely object-oriented
        language which has enabled developers to work productively while also making the Rails frameworks require less effort to learn. As well as this, Ruby gains favorability with web developers from the extensive amount of open source code made available
        by the Rails community, as well as the majority of Rails’ libraries being open source, removing any licensing costs for developers (Ford, 2014). Ruby continues to develop as a programming language through the support it gets from its community.
        With ‘Ruby User Groups’, ‘Mailing Lists and Newsgroups’, blogs, conferences and a GitHub repository; avid Ruby users are able to contribute to the improvement of the language while also being able to gain support and advice on their own projects
        (Ruby Community Page, 2017).</P>

      <p><em>These improvements will likely have an improvement on following work as
         it encourages a more professional syntax of writing which prioritises clarity
         and impersonality.</em></p>
    </div>


    <h2 id='week6'><span class="long-underline">Week 6</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Further insight was gained this week on the process of writing and launching a webpage.</li>
    <li>The VM and WinSCP can be utilised to launch a site. For reference: </li>

  <h2 id='week7'><span class="long-underline">Week 7 - Reading Week</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Discoveries this week largely came from the insights gained peer reviewing literature reviews.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2 id='week8'><span class="long-underline">Week 8</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Discovery was made in the realm of CSS, looking at the effective practices to separate style and form, See below for examples of CSS selectors.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Examples of using class and id selectors:
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Class Selectors</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    CSS:
  </p>
  <pre>
    .discounted_bargain {
	     color: red;
    }

    .damaged_stock {
	    background: yellow;
    }
  </pre>
  <p>
    HTML:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;p class="damaged_stock discounted_bargain"&gt;
Child's Tricycle
    &lt;/p&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>
    <b>ID Selectors</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    CSS:
  </p>
  <pre>
    #special_section {
	     background: yellow;
    }
  </pre>
  <p>
    HTML:
  </p>
  <pre>
    &lt;p id="special_section"&gt;Child's Tricycle&lt;/p&gt;
  </pre>

  <h2 id='week9'><span class="long-underline">Week 9</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Discovery has been made on practices to develop efficiency. Such practices can include using: snippets, Atom Packages, editor features and themes.</li>
    <li>Further understanding on the positioning of elements is needed.</li>
    <li>Below is an example of how snippets can be created.</li>
    <li>More details on writing snippets can be found in the <a href="http://flight-manual.atom.io/using-atom/sections/snippets/">Atom Flight Manual</a></li>
    <li>Below are snippet examples.</li>
  </ul>
  <pre class="snippet-eg">
    '.text.html':
  'skeleton':
    'prefix': 'html'
    'body': '&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;$1&lt;/title&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;$1&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n$2'

  </ul>

  <h2 id='week11'><span class="long-underline">Week 11</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Week 11 was used to explore the use of images within HTML and CSS.</li>
    <li>In order to make the most out of Images on the web, and to develop your website's semantic value, it is good practice not to have a only describe and image with an &lt;img&lt; tag; but instead to use things such as figures and figcaptions to give the images more meaning.</li>
    <li>Viewport Widths and Viewport Heights are a far better method for defining size than pixels.</li>
  </ul>


  <h2 id='week12'><span class="long-underline">Week 12</span></h2>
