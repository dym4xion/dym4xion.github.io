    <h1>Advanced Programming Concepts</h1>
    <section>
      <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <p>As well as going through the outcomes for the unit, the first ADPROC
      lecture focused on refreshing concepts surrounding Classes and Objects.</p>
      <p>Don't forget: <strong>An objects is and instance of a class.</strong></p>
      <p>In the practical session we looked at implementing an 'Acrostic Method'
      and then implementing an acrostic method that worked on a string but in reverse.
      The reverse method was particularly difficult, so make sure go over how it
      <a href="media/acrosticBack.txt" target="_blank">works.</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Week 2</h2>
      <p>
        In the lecture this week we looked at object instantiation, references and
        passing parameters. It's important to remember that an object reference
        denoted the memory location of an object but does not contain the data of
        an object. Also that if an object is given another reference, the same object
        and data will be accessed even from the new object reference. Don't forget about
        the differnce between passing by value and passing by refernce (think about how values may change).

        How to declare and instantiate an object in Java: <pre>ClassName objectName = new ClassName(param);</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the tutorial this week we developed upon what we looked over in the lecture
        by revisiting how to write classes and the necessary (accessor/mutator) and
        operational methods associated with a particular class.

      <h2>Week 3</h2>
      <p>
        In this week's lecture we looked at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">The Unified Modelling Language</a>, and
        it's implementaions. This led to looking at how user defined data types can
        be used to encapsulate data and functionality. Sepecific diagrams we looked at
        include: interaction, statechart, activity, use case, class, class hierarchy,
        domain model, and instance diagrams.
      </p>
      <p>In the tutorial we refreshed our knowledge of objects and classes.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Week 4</h2>
      <p>In this week's lecture we looked into Java I/O exception handling. This included
      looking at how Java handles inputs in the form of Byte and Character 'Streams'.
      The Reader and Writer classes used with character streams controls the conversion
      of bytes to/from characters. The Scnner class breaks input into 'tokens', deliminated
      by whitespace. Input mismatch error can be rectified with try/catch blocks. </p>

      <p>In the lab session we investigated use of the Scanner class to read input
         from the keyboard.</p>
