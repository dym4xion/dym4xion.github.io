    <h1>Computer Architecture</h1>
    <p>
      In the Computer Architecture unit of my course I exlpored topics such
      as boolean algebra, logic circuits, CPU design and the role of operating
      systems.

      <h2>Intrusion Circuit Design - CW1</h2>
      <p>
        For our first CAR  coursework, we were tasked with designing an intrusion
        logic circuit that needed to consider certain switches representing doors and
        windows that would output the appropriate alarm for specific situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The circuit was designed in <a href="https://logic.ly/">Logicly</a>.

      <h2>Intrusion Circuit Optimisation - CW2</h2>
      <p>
        In our second CAR coursework, we aimed to optimise and prove the
        optimisation of out Intrusion Circuit developed during the previous coursework.
        Through using boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps, we we're able to demonstrate
        that the circuit we developed in CW1 was optimised.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were also tasked with simplifiying and converting our Intrusion Circuit
        into a circuit entirely comprised of a universal gate of our choice. We
        chose to convert our circuit into a NAND only circuit.

      <h2>CPU  Poster - CW3</h2>
      <p>
        In out third coursework we were tasked with creating a poster which discussed
        the functional elements surrounding a CPU as well as covering topics such as von
        Neumann architecture and the fetch execute cycle.

      <h2>OS Presentation - CW4</h2>
      <p>
        In our final coursework piece we prepared a presentation to discuss a hypothetical
        operating system for a hypothetical Augmented Reality glasses device.
